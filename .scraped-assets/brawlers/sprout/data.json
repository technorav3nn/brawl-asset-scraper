As a result, it’s difficult for Sprout to attack enemies that are close to it unless nearby walls are used to assist them, which will allow Sprout’s attacks to reach enemies easier. However, Sprout has greater damage potential at longer ranges because the attack bounces, in which hitting enemies is easier due to the range increase from the bouncing. Because of this, you can auto-aim with Sprout unlike other throwers as the attack can bounce on the ground and off walls.","Sprout's Seed Bombs' range increases from each bounce before exploding, just like Rico's projectiles. So, it's recommended to aim them diagonally towards walls to increase Sprout's range.","Aiming the Seed Bombs against walls can also help in close-range interactions. By bouncing the Seed Bombs against walls, the Seed Bombs will bounce back in Sprout's direction, effectively landing a hit on enemies close by. This strategy is effective with the Photosynthesis Starpower, allowing Sprout to tank shots while hitting enemies.","Sprout can prevent enemies from escaping the poison clouds with its Super in Showdown/Duo Showdown, potentially knocking enemies out, and Sprout can increase the damage by attacking while the enemy can’t provide counter fire. This is especially useful in Cavern Churn and other maps with an abundance of walls.","Sprout's Super is effective at blocking off vital choke points and essential areas, effectively leaving only one or two passages for enemies to pass through in many situations. This causes them to group together, allowing for an effective team wipe, especially with area attackers on your team such as Jessie.","In maps with very narrow choke-points like G.G. Mortuary in Heist and Split in Hot Zone, Sprout can use its Hedge along with its Transplant Gadget to almost permanently block those routes, preventing the enemies from reaching the important area.","Sprout’s attack radius can damage multiple enemies, especially if it has its Overgrowth Star Power equipped. Hitting multiple opponents charges its Super faster and deals a lot more damage, despite Sprout’s moderately low damage output, so always take advantage of the situation if enemies group together.","Sprout's walls can be used to block the ball from being shot into the goal in Brawl Ball. Paired with Transplant, Hedge can become an almost-permanent barrier. However, be wary that Hedge can be destroyed with invulnerability shields, so Sprout and its teammates should avoid running into the barrier in an attempt to defend the goal.","Sprout is viable in maps with a lot of bushes when its Garden Mulcher Gadget and Photosynthesis Star Power equipped, as these both make Sprout hard to defeat. As long as there is a decent amount of walls to hide behind, this shouldn't be too risky as long as ambushers are watched out for.","Sprout's Transplant gadget can be really useful in weekend modes like Robo Rumble or Last Stand to prevent the bots from attacking the safe or 8-Bit, specially if these targets are in places of the map with horizontal walls, making them being protected for long periods of time."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"03/04/20:","description":"Sprout became available to play in the Training Cave.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"10/04/20:","description":"Sprout became available to play in matches.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"15/04/20:","description":"Brawlers with invulnerability shields can now destroy Sprout's hedges.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"15/04/20:","description":"Sprout's Garden Mulcher Gadget healing was decreased to 2000 (from 3000).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"15/04/20:","description":"Sprout's Overgrowth Star Power explosion radius increase was decreased by 50%.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"22/04/20:","description":"Sprout's Photosynthesis Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"13/05/20:","description":"Sprout's main attack damage was decreased to 940 (from 1000).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"22/05/20:","description":"The Tropical Sprout skin was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"02/07/20:","description":"Sprout's Overgrowth Star Power now applies to any attack (from only affecting attacks that do not hit a target before bouncing).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"02/07/20:","description":"The number of hits necessary to charge Sprout's Super was increased to 5 (from 4).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"02/07/20:","description":"Sprout's Overgrowth Star Power now takes 5 seconds to charge.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"10/09/20:","description":"Sprout and Tropical Sprout winning animation was reworked.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"28/09/20:","description":"The Lunar Sprout skin was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"13/11/20:","description":"Sprout's Transplant Gadget was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"15/12/20:","description":"Sprout was given an attack landing indicator (X).","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"27/01/21:","description":"Sprout's main attack damage was increased to 1020 (from 940).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"07/02/21:","description":"Fixed an issue with Sprout's Super related to Brawl Ball.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"07/02/21:","description":"Fixed an issue with Sprout's Super being able to knock back boxes in Showdown.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"07/04/21:","description":"Sprout's main attack damage was decreased to 980 (from 1020).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"07/04/21:","description":"Sprout's Garden Mulcher Gadget healing was decreased to 1500 (from 2000).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"01/10/21:","description":"Sprout's Emerald Prince and Ruby Prince skins were added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"03/11/21:","description":"Fixed a bug where Sprout’s Super could destroy spike tiles when it landed.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"01/03/22:","description":"Sprout's True Silver and True Gold skins were added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"17/03/22:","description":"The Corrupted Sprout skin was added.
