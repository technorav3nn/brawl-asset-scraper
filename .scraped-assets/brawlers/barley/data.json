It’s recommended to attack from behind walls where the enemies can’t hit you as easily than if you’re out in the open.","Barley's attack can be used for area control, deeming it effective to discourage enemy movement through certain areas or paths. Take advantage of this to keep enemies out of critical areas of the map, such as the Gem mine in Gem Grab, the zones in Hot Zone, or the Bolts in Siege.","Barley's Super can deal tons of damage if an enemy is unable to quickly escape from the liquid. Try to aim the Super to have it land within the enemy standing in the middle of it or trapped against a wall, and use your Sticky Syrup Mixer Gadget to prolong and maximize your damage output.","Combining Barley's Super with Spike's can deal huge damage to enemies trapped by both. Spike's Super slows the enemy's movement speed, hindering them from escaping while Barley's Super deals damage.","Barley is a menace in Duo Showdown if he is paired with a heavyweight such as El Primo, Rosa, or Bull. You can follow your teammate around and use Barley's attack to damage enemies while the tank finishes them off. The same applies to Power Cubes; if there are multiple boxes near your spawn, you can use your attacks to break them by stacking their damage.","Auto-aiming with Barley often causes you to miss your shot or only deal 1 tick of damage. Because Barley's attacks last for two ticks, if you aim the shot in front of where an enemy will head, you’ll either hinder their movement or cause them to take two ticks of damage.","Barley is a great Siege Brawler mainly because he’s a control Brawler, excellent at area denial. He can force the enemies back with his long-lasting attacks and Super so that his team can retrieve the Bolts. When playing Barley in Siege, try to stay alive when your Siege Bot spawns. Barley is usually the primary damage dealer to the IKE. Additionally, Barley's Super has an extremely long range, making it able to reach the IKE without entering its range.","Barley can be effective in Heist, if used correctly. Barley's Super has an incredibly long range, allowing it to safely deal damage to the Heist safe. Since the safe is a stationary target, it’ll take both ticks of damage from his main attack as well as all ticks from his Super.","Barley's Extra Noxious Star Power allows Barley's attacks to deal more damage. This makes Barley to become a more aggressive Brawler, especially from behind walls. This Star Power enables Barley to become very strong on modes like Heist and Siege.","His Medical Use Star Power is more map-dependent, best used in game modes where controlling the field is more important than eliminating enemy Brawlers. This includes events such as Gem Grab, Heist, and Siege. Medical Use increases his survivability, allowing you to continuously attack instead of retreating, and giving up ground to heal up. This Star Power can be paired with his Herbal Tonic Gadget to provide healing when there aren't other healers on your team.","Barley's Sticky Syrup Mixer Gadget can be more useful than one would assume. It can be used when defending a goal in Brawl Ball and can discourage tanks from chasing you. Surprisingly, you can use this to bush-camp with Barley. Hide in a bush, and when an enemy walks by, use your Sticky Syrup Mixer Gadget to slow them and burst them down. If done correctly, this either takes out the enemy or deals tremendous amounts of damage, forcing them to retreat. Barley's Sticky Syrup Mixer Gadget is especially useful against tanks and close-ranged assassins since it usually slows them down enough to where Barley can out-range and deal a large amount of damage to them.","Against opponents on the opposing side of a wall, Barley can also use his gadget followed by 3 attacks to effectively take down most of the Brawlers in the game. This melee Barley strategy is especially effective with the addition of bushes, because Barley's damage can be deceivingly high."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Barley","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/barley/skins/Barley/Default.png"},{"name":"Wizard","cost":"Free for linking Supercell ID","campaign":"Clash Stories","path":"/brawlers/barley/skins/Barley/Wizard.png"},{"name":"Golden","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/barley/skins/Barley/Golden.png"},{"name":"Red Wizard","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling, available after unlocking Wizard Barley","campaign":"Clash Stories","path":"/brawlers/barley/skins/Barley/Red%20Wizard.png"},{"name":"Maple","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","path":"/brawlers/barley/skins/Barley/Maple.png"},{"name":"Unicorn Knight","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","campaign":"Once Upon","path":"/brawlers/barley/skins/Barley/Unicorn%20Knight.png"},{"name":"Bakesale","cost":"149 Gems","campaign":"Retropolis Nights","path":"/brawlers/barley/skins/Barley/Bakesale.png"},{"name":"Sway Master","cost":"149 Gems","campaign":"Lunar Brawl","path":"/brawlers/barley/skins/Barley/Sway%20Master.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/barley/skins/Barley/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/barley/skins/Barley/True%20Gold.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/barley/skins/Barley/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[2400,2640,2880,3120,3360,3600,3840,4080,4320,4560,4800],"attack":{"name":"Undiluted","description":"Barley lobs a bottle, breaking it on the ground.
