Colt specializes in long-ranged combat and can out-range close-ranged Brawlers very easily.","Try to follow the enemy's movement. The full potential of your attack requires all of the bullets to hit the enemy. Predicting the enemy's movement allows all of the bullets to hit and deals massive damage. If they dodge a lot, shoot behind them so that they walk into your bullets. The inverse also works; If they keep walking into your attack when you use prediction to shoot, keep shooting that way.","Colt's Super can be used to devastate enemies directly or can be used to destroy enemy cover so that Colt or his teammates can rush in and finish the enemies off. In addition, his Super can also restrict enemies from passing through an area for it's duration.","Colt does best on open maps, where he can easily control the map, out-ranging close-ranged Brawlers with his attacks and Super. In addition to Colt's effectiveness on open maps, his Magnum Special Star Power increases his effectiveness on these maps as it grants him additional range and therefore increases his area of control.","Colt's Slick Boots allows him to move faster, making chasing or escaping to cover easier. Slick Boots is also excellent for dodging projectiles from other long-ranged Brawlers.","In Brawl Ball, if the goal still has 2 blocks on the ends or if any goal walls are still present, you can kick the ball into a wall, then immediately use your Super or Silver Bullet to break the walls, enabling the ball to go through the goal with the new open space. However, don't destroy the walls on your own goal because it inadvertently allows the enemies to kick the ball through to your goal.","Colt's Speedloader Gadget can be extremely useful when attacking the enemy safe/IKE or a Siege Bot in Heist or Siege. The additional ammo it provides can deal massive damage even when Colt is out of ammo and potentially hinder the enemy team.","In Team Events, it's best to pair Colt up with Brawlers with stunning, pulling, and slowing abilities to make it easier to hit all of his bullets.","When being attacked by Mortis, try to keep moving to one direction and shooting to the exact opposite way Colt is facing. Because Mortis lands slightly behind or in Colt with his attack, he has to follow him with subsequent attacks if Colt keeps moving the same way, making Mortis run into all of the bullets.","While Colt's Speedloader Gadget passively gives you multiple times the damage of his Silver Bullet Gadget due to the increased ammo, it's still difficult to hit all bullets even at close range, as Silver Bullet, in addition to clearing the landscape, essentially guarantees a hit in close-quarters combat or allows to ambush and surprise the enemies by clearing obstacles. Therefore, if you can hit most shots consistently, for example in highly restricted maps or against stationery or slow targets, Speedloader is a better choice as you can benefit from 2 full ammo over Silver Bullet, which grants you less damage for one ammo.","Colt's Silver Bullet Gadget can be used to clear obstacles, which is useful in a lot of situations. For example, in Showdown, he can use Silver Bullet to destroy certain obstacles that enemies are hiding behind and finish them off or to connect otherwise separated lanes in 3v3 Events.","Colt's health makes him especially vulnerable, so don't often use him in survival-based game modes like in Showdown, Hot Zone and Bounty as he tends to lose 1v1 lane interactions. He excels at supporting teammates as a pseudo-sniper with high damage potential and the ability to destroy walls in Duo Showdown, Brawl Ball and Heist."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"16/08/17:","description":"Colt's main attack range was increased to 10.66 tiles (from 10).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"16/08/17:","description":"His main attack projectile speed was increased by 9%.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"12/09/17:","description":"Colt's health was increased to 700 (from 600).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"12/09/17:","description":"His reload time was decreased to 1.25 seconds (from 1.5).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"07/12/17:","description":"Colt's Super recharge rate was decreased by 17%.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"07/12/17:","description":"Colt's Slick Boots Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"07/12/17:","description":"The health and damage statistics of all Brawlers were multiplied by 4.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"18/12/17:","description":"Colt's reload time was increased to 1.5 seconds (from 1.25).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"22/12/17:","description":"Colt's main attack range was decreased to 10 tiles (from 10.66).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"16/01/18:","description":"Colt's main attack range was decreased to 9 tiles (from 10).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"16/01/18:","description":"His Slick Boots Star Power speed boost was decreased to 50 points (from 100).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"Colt's Slick Boots Star Power speed boost was increased to 60 points (from 50).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"His projectile size was increased.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"Every Brawler's movement speed was increased by 70 points, increasing Colt's base movement speed to 720 (from 650).","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"All Brawlers' projectile speeds are increased by 9%.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"23/03/18:","description":"Colt's main attack size was decreased by 50%.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"09/04/18:","description":"Colt's main attack and Super damage were decreased to 300 (from 320) per bullet.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"21/05/18:","description":"Colt's reload time was increased to 1.6 seconds (from 1.5).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"29/05/18:","description":"Colt's main attack damage was decreased to 280 (from 300) per bullet.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"18/06/18:","description":"Colt's Super range was decreased to 11 tiles (from 13.33).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"05/12/18:","description":"Colt's main attack damage were increased to 300 (from 280) per bullet.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"29/01/19:","description":"Colt and Rockstar Colt were remodeled and their animations were reworked.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"29/01/19:","description":"The Royal Agent Colt skin was added to the game.
