Her attacks can deal massive amounts of damage to them, but without proper support and understanding of her abilities, she struggles to take enemies out in a short amount of time. Therefore, she synergizes with assassins like Crow as she can quickly bring enemies to low health and allow the assassins to finish them off.","Use walls and other obstacles to your advantage when using Colette's Super. Even without her Push It Star Power, Colette can still hit an enemy twice quickly if they are close to a wall while using her Super.","If she hits two quick shots and a Super, Colette can defeat every Brawler in the game provided that they do not have any shields or passive healing abilities. Her Super has a quick charging rate along with her attack, so she can do this multiple times. This can be aided with her Mass Tax Star Power, which protects her as she charges.","Colette's Super can be used to collect gems and return to cover, making her a good last-resort gem carrier in Gem Grab if your primary gem carrier is suddenly defeated. Her Super can also be used to collect Power Cubes in Showdown or Bolts in Siege.","Beware of using your Super against Brawlers with high burst damage like Bull since they can easily defeat you when you rush into them, so make sure to have exhausted their ammo before using your Super on them. With her Push It Star Power, however, you can briefly immobilize high-burst Brawlers while using your Super as well as finish them off when they are on sufficiently low health with two hits, so Push It is a safe way to use Colette's Super effectively against such Brawlers.","Colette with her Super is capable of defeating the enemy team. Her Super's large width can hit multiple enemies, and if she hits two Brawlers both when dashing forward and dashing back, she immediately charges another Super, effectively allowing her to use her Super again for massive amounts of damage.","Colette's Push It Star Power can be used like Gale's Super. In 3v3 modes, it can be used to either interrupt a Brawler's Super, like Frank's, or to push them away to help buy teammates some time to gain control of the center of the map. Another use is to remove the ball from an enemy in Brawl Ball. It also guarantees that the Colette can hit the enemy twice with her Super as the enemies are unable to dodge. Additionally, Colette can push Brawlers into the gas or meteors in Showdown and Knockout.","When using Colette in Showdown, keep chipping off at enemies' health at a distance until you can use your Super or Na-ah Gadget to finish them off. Be mindful about how the enemy can counter your two shots and Super combo, such as shields, healing, or damage debuffs.","Colette is a very strong Brawler in Heist. The heist safe counts as a special target to Colette, meaning that at Power Level 11, she can do around 3000 damage per hit with her Super, effectively dealing 6000 damage, or around 10% of the safe's health, with one Super. She can also recharge her Super if she hits defending enemies along with the safe. Combined with her fast Super charge rate and Mass Tax Star Power, she can repeatedly use her Super on the safe while reducing damage taken so she survives longer. Alternatively, her Push It Star Power is useful as it can push enemies away from the safe while defending, and push defending enemies away when attacking the enemy safe (allowing shorter-ranged Brawlers to offend easier).","Colette also has an excellent synergy with Byron in Heist, as Colette can continuously get healed by Byron's attacks and Super while she repeatedly dashes into the safe with her own Super. This is even more effective if Colette uses her Mass Tax Star Power.","Colette can use her Na-ah! Gadget and a Super to take out any target under 4500 health. Remember this interaction to take easy kills on low-health Brawlers and ones that would otherwise counter her, such as Surge."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Colette","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/colette/skins/Colette/Default.png"},{"name":"Navigator","cost":"79 Gems","campaign":"Lunar Brawl","path":"/brawlers/colette/skins/Colette/Navigator.png"},{"name":"Gladiator","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Supercell Make","path":"/brawlers/colette/skins/Colette/Gladiator.png"},{"name":"Inspector","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Power League","path":"/brawlers/colette/skins/Colette/Inspector.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/colette/skins/Colette/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/colette/skins/Colette/True%20Gold.png"},{"name":"Trixie","cost":"Brawl Pass Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/colette/skins/Colette/Trixie.png"},{"name":"Pinku Pawlette","cost":"Brawl Pass Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/colette/skins/Colette/Pinku%20Pawlette.png"},{"name":"Kiiro Pawlette","cost":"Brawl Pass Plus Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/colette/skins/Colette/Kiiro%20Pawlette.png"},{"name":"Midori Pawlette","cost":"Brawl Pass Plus Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/colette/skins/Colette/Midori%20Pawlette.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/colette/skins/Colette/"}],"hypercharge":[{"name":"Teen Spirit","description":"Colette's spirit follows her during her dash, damaging enemies on the way.","path":"/hypercharges/Teen%20Spirit.png"}],"healthByLevel":[3400,3740,4080,4420,4760,5100,5440,5780,6120,6460,6800],"attack":{"name":"Taxing Shot","description":"Colette fires a shot that takes what you owe!
