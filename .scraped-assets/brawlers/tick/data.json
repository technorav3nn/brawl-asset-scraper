This makes it almost impossible to destroy.","Do not launch all of Tick's mines at once. It’s not ideal since it leaves you defenseless and unable to block off choke points due to his slow reload speed and the potential damage is subpar compared to the area control your team gets.","Tick has the lowest health of any Brawler and a very slow reload speed, but his long range, area denial abilities, and high damage output compensate for these weaknesses. Hence, it’s a necessity to take cover and attack from behind walls while playing Tick. Tick thrives in maps with an abundance of walls such as Open Plaza because he can stay behind the walls and support himself and his teammates.","Tick is very effective at control, which is amplified with his Mine Mania Gadget. Predict where enemies will head and throw your mines there instead of throwing your mines directly at them. This forces them back because if enemies walk into the mines, they’ll take a huge amount of damage. Tick can hamper enemies from collecting vital items or heading into vital areas such as the Gem mine in Gem Grab, Bolts in Siege, the blue star in Bounty, or the zones in Hot Zone by throwing mines at the above items or areas.","Tick's head can inflict high area damage that can also destroy obstacles and is capable of chasing Brawlers into closed areas. His head can be easily destroyed from a range however due to it's low health and short range, so it’s best to use it against low-health enemies to force them to attack the head and prevent them from healing or an enemy who has used up all ammo. He can also use his Super in Brawl Ball on enemy defenders near their goal, because the head can defeat them with it’s high area damage as well as break obstacles to help teammates score at ease.","Tick’s struggle in close-ranged combat makes him prone to being ambushed in bush areas. However, Tick also has an advantage in bush areas. His head can be used in bushes and it would detect and damage the nearest enemy while it would be unnoticeable. He can also throw his mines at narrow lanes so that enemies take damage, which reveals them and prevents them from from sneaking up on you and your teammates.","Tick is niche in Showdown because of his long range, control abilities, and high damage output. However, he’s more effective in Duo Showdown because of a teammate that can mitigate his weaknesses such as his low health and his struggle in close-ranged combat. He can annoy enemies by placing mines all around them and they’ll have to escape by walking into the mines and taking high damage, and if the enemies aren’t already dead, Tick’s teammate can finish those enemies off. In addition, Tick can trap enemies in the poison gas by continuously deploying mines at exit points until they die to the poison gas.","If Tick is being chased by close-ranged Brawlers, refrain from auto-aiming because Tick's mines will simply go over the enemy's head. To defend yourself, aim mines between yourself and the enemy, and the enemy should walk into the mines while chasing you. If the enemy avoids the mines, use his Super or Last Hurrah Gadget to knock them back into the mines. You can also defend yourself at close range with his Super or Last Hurrah Gadget regularly, but you must use them carefully. For his Last Hurrah Gadget, you should position yourself when using it so enemies aren’t knocked into a wall, because if they do, they can re-approach you. If you can’t position yourself on a closed map, aim his attack at yourself to discourage reapproach. Throw his Super in front of the enemy rather than throwing it behind the enemy to knock them away from you, therefore allowing you to escape.","Tick’s mines are more effective if Brawlers like Gale, Bibi, or Gene push, knock, or pull enemies into them, dealing massive damage to the enemies. If you see the respective Brawler with their disruptive ability charged up, you'll want to throw your mines in the direction the enemy will head.","Tick can discourage enemies from using teleporters or launchpads by deploying his mines to the location where the enemy will end up, guaranteeing massive damage if not defeating them once they land or teleport. This is a viable strategy in some maps such as Ends Meet and Gem Bash. If the enemies manage to survive, he can place extra mines in front of or behind of the teleporter/landing area depending on the enemies’ movement.","Tick is a useful asset in Knockout. Tick is most useful in closed maps where he can hide and attack from behind walls. He can control areas with his mines and his Super allows him to finish off low-health enemies and is a counter to assassins and heavyweights. His Star Powers and his Gadgets are beneficial in this mode: Well Oiled allows Tick to recover from damage insanely quickly, and Automa-Tick Reload allows him to attack faster; Mine Mania makes him momentarily deal even more damage, finishing off enemies more efficiently or covering more ground, and Last Hurrah allows him to withstand more damage and counter heavyweights and assassins.","Due to Tick’s very slow reload speed, he’s not often recommended in Heist, so be sure to use him wisely in this mode. On offense, hide and attack the safe behind obstacles, which is effective as you’ll deal high damage to the safe while the enemies can’t hit you, and if possible, use his Mine Mania Gadget, his Super, and his Automa-Tick Reload Star Power to amplify your damage potential on the safe. On defense, hide behind obstacles and block off any choke points that inadvertently allow enemies to damage the safe, and, if possible, use his Last Hurrah Gadget and his Super to knock enemies away from the safe."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"26/06/19:","description":"Tick was added to the game.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"21/08/19:","description":"Tick's Automa-Tick Reload Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"29/08/19:","description":"Tick's main attack mine explosion radius was increased by 11%.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"29/08/19:","description":"His Super no longer chases or explodes airborne targets.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"18/09/19:","description":"Tick's Automa-Tick Reload Star Power reload boost was decreased to 13% (from 15%).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"09/10/19:","description":"Tick's main attack mine explosion radius was decreased by 6%.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"09/10/19:","description":"His main attack mine duration was decreased to 1.6 seconds (from 2).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"09/10/19:","description":"His mines are now deployed in a fixed pattern on the ground.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"23/10/19:","description":"Tick's main attack mine duration was increased to 2 seconds (from 1.6 seconds).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"23/10/19:","description":"His Automa-Tick Reload Star Power reload boost was decreased to 10% (from 13%).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"19/02/20:","description":"Tick's main attack damage was increased to 680 (from 640) per mine.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"17/03/20:","description":"Tick's Backup Mine Gadget was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"13/05/20:","description":"Tick's mine pattern is now correctly mirrored for both teams.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"16/07/20:","description":"The King Crab Tick skin was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"10/09/20:","description":"The number of hits necessary to charge Tick's Super was decreased to 6 hits (from 9).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"11/11/20:","description":"Tick's head will now return to Tick if there are no enemies present on the battlefield.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"15/12/20:","description":"Tick's reload time was increased to 2.3 seconds (from 2.2).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"15/12/20:","description":"His Automa-Tick Reload Star Power reload boost was decreased to 9% (from 10%).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"15/12/20:","description":"Tick's True Silver and True Gold skins were added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"19/12/20:","description":"The Snowman Tick skin was added.
