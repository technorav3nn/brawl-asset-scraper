She can place her puddles over the Gem mine or a zone and prohibit enemies from achieving the respective event objective. If an enemy attempts to cross the puddle, she can ignite it to deal significant damage to the enemy. In addition, the puddles from her Super and Fire Starters Gadget can connect to create an extremely large puddle to control massive areas. The area control provided from the puddles is amplified with her Wild Flames Star Power. You can either connect the puddles to clear bushes or separate them to allow for select area denial.","Amber's Wild Flames Star Power and Fire Starters Gadget are extremely useful in helping Amber quickly regain her Super, especially when Supers are most necessary. With her Fire Starters Gadget, she can create a large puddle area in which her Super recharges, allowing for an insane pace of Supers while fighting.","Trails from her Fire Starters Gadget can also be used as firewalls to protect you and allies. Make sure to keep puddles connected so enemies, especially heavyweights and assassins, are damaged when crossing the puddles.","Be careful about positioning Amber's Super because if it's thrown in an undesirable position, you might accidentally ignite the puddle when attacking an enemy near it, so try to place the fluid outside your attacking spot but still in your range so you can ignite the puddle at the right time. This also enables you to control two lanes at once.","Try to predict the enemy's movement in order to land more shots, because there's a tiny yet noticeable delay between aiming and firing. You'll deal maximum damage by aiming where the enemy is likely to move as aiming at the enemy's current position won't damage the moving enemy since Amber's flames travel slowly.","Amber is an excellent counter to high-health Brawlers because her continuous attack deals enough damage to eliminate them. She can also use her Super to prevent them from healing and finish them off. However, maintain your distance from these Brawlers because Amber, with her moderate health, can be two-shotted or three-shotted by those Brawlers if they get close enough, and she's helpless at close range due to her inability to deal immediate damage and her lack of stuns, slows, or knockbacks to distance herself from such Brawlers.","Try not to waste ammo with Amber. If Amber is out of ammo, she needs to wait a while to fully reload despite what seems to be an incredibly fast reload speed. With her Scorchin' Siphon Star Power, you can partially mitigate this issue by using her Super or her Fire Starters Gadget to reload quicker. You can also place her Fire Starters Gadget at your spawn point and reload quicker if you die. If you do this you will enter battle with a full ammo bar.","If you have the Wild Flames Star Power, when you get your Super and throw it, sometimes it is a better idea to wait and keep the Super on the ground so that you charge up more of your Super. This is a good strategy in passive maps and also good if you aren't going to hit an enemy with it, as you can charge another Super."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"22/10/20:","description":"Amber became available to play in the Training Cave.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"23/10/20:","description":"Amber became available to play in matches.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"29/10/20:","description":"Amber's health was decreased to 3000 (from 3300).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"29/10/20:","description":"The number of hits necessary to charge her Super was increased to 22 hits (from 17).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"29/10/20:","description":"Her Super damage was decreased to 1800 (from 2000).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"29/10/20:","description":"Her Super recharge rate was decreased by 16%.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"29/10/20:","description":"Fixed an issue which caused Amber to gain increased Super charge rate with increased Power Levels.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"29/10/20:","description":"Fixed an issue where Amber's Super only dealt 1 damage if she was defeated right before igniting her Super.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"11/11/20:","description":"Amber's movement speed was decreased to 720 (from 820).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"11/11/20:","description":"Her main attack damage per second was decreased to 2000 (from 2400).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"13/11/20:","description":"Amber's Scorchin' Siphon Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"27/01/21:","description":"Amber's health was increased to 3200 (from 3000).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"27/01/21:","description":"Her main attack damage per second was increased to 2200 (from 2000).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"15/03/21:","description":"Amber's Super damage was increased to 1920 (from 1800).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"15/03/21:","description":"Amber's main attack damage per second was decreased to 2000 (from 2200).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"07/04/21:","description":"Amber's reload time was increased to 8.8 seconds (from 8).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"28/05/21:","description":"The Amber de la Vega skin was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"27/10/21:","description":"Amber's True Silver and True Gold skins were added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"27/10/21:","description":"Amber's class was changed to Damage Dealer (from Firebreather).","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"01/03/22:","description":"Amber de la Vega's attack and Super visual effects were reworked.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"27/04/22:","description":"Amber's Dancing Flames Gadget was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"17/12/22:","description":"The Frost Queen Amber skin was added.
