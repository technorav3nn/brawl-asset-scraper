This strictly limits throwers that can otherwise take cover behind walls.","Jacky's attack circles around her, which means that she can attack behind her, so if an enemy approaches you from behind, you can still hit them, as long as they are close to you. However, keep in mind that her attack is instantaneous, so you cannot run to extend your range.","Jacky has the same movement speed as other heavyweights. This means that she can catch up to Brawlers that are escaping from her. If she has her Pneumatic Booster Gadget, this can be useful when chasing other fast Brawlers like Max and will help in game modes like Brawl Ball, Bounty and Showdown. With her high health as well, she can rush enemies and defeat them easily. However, be wary of slowing Gadgets and Supers like Bea's and Emz's Super since they will slow Jacky down, making them outrange Jacky.","The quick burst of speed from her Pneumatic Booster Gadget is helpful to position Jacky quickly, escape in dangerous situations or when low on health, hunt enemies down, or secure vital items like Bolts in Siege or Gems in Gem Grab.","Jacky can use her Super to pull in enemies before using her attack since she requires to be close to enemies to damage them. Note that her ammo won't recharge during her Super, so make sure to reload all your ammo before you use her Super. Jacky's Super can also be used to interrupt potentially dangerous Supers (like Carl's or Frank's), or to drag away enemies from the goal in Brawl Ball to her. Pairing her with a Brawler that deals area damage is very effective when you use her Super, like Dynamike. First, pull the enemies in with your Super. Then, the other Brawler can attack the pulled in enemies with their Super, dealing massive damage and leading to a potential team-wipe, which can be devastating to enemies.","In Brawl Ball, if an enemy holding the Ball gets caught in her Super, the Ball drops. This allows teammates to quickly steal the Ball or prevent an enemy from scoring. In addition, Jacky has a high damage output, high health, and a fast movement speed, which is better justified with her Pneumatic Booster Gadget, making Jacky very viable in this event.","Jacky's attack is unique; auto-aiming or manually aiming renders the same attack direction and range. Because of this, players can focus on other aspects of the match such as dodging attacks and positioning, although players can still aim to see the attack range when they need to.","In Showdown, Jacky's circular area damage mechanics along with her high damage is useful in some maps to destroy large groups of Power Cube Boxes in maps like Feast or Famine, Dark Passage, Two Thousand Lakes and Acid Lakes. However, since her range is short like other heavyweights, she should prioritize getting Power Cubes and should avoid immediate conflict with other Brawlers.","Jacky, despite being a tank, can't outmatch other tanks. This is because she reloads rather slowly and doesn't deal enough damage to eliminate such Brawlers with three ammo. Since all other heavyweights reload faster and/or deal more damage than her (like Bull), she can neither defeat heavyweights in three shots nor can she reload fast enough to get a fourth one before getting eliminated. When facing Bull, Shelly, or Darryl, try to stay out of their range as much as possible, while attacking them. Using your Pneumatic Booster Gadget to escape from them is also possible.","Jacky should focus on picking on low-medium health Brawlers or low-damaging and slow-reloading ones. If a Brawler reloads slower or deals less damage, Jacky can eliminate them easily as she has high health and high health and can withstand three to five of their shots. In addition, make sure that the enemy has exhausted all their ammo so you can get close to them without taking major damage from being out-ranged.","When trying to pull an enemy with your Super, try to drag the joystick to know if the enemy is in your Super range or not.","Due to Jacky's short range, she isn't ideal for extremely open maps such as Purple Paradise in Bounty, where long-ranged Brawlers will outrange her and fend Jacky off. If playing Jacky on an open map, use her Hardy Hard Hat Star Power because she can rush enemies and dodge their shots, and she can withstand more damage. Her Counter Crush Star Power is less useful since its range won't be enough to defeat long-ranged Brawlers from a range, and is used to engage in close-ranged combat.","Remember that Jacky does have a slow reload speed, so after attacking or defeating an enemy, you would want to stay out of the battle and heal up or reload your ammo, instead of going too aggressive on enemies."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Jacky","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/jacky/skins/Jacky/Default.png"},{"name":"Constructor","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/jacky/skins/Jacky/Constructor.png"},{"name":"Gift Express","cost":"79 Gems","campaign":"Brawlidays","path":"/brawlers/jacky/skins/Jacky/Gift%20Express.png"},{"name":"Ultra Driller","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Robots & Monsters","path":"/brawlers/jacky/skins/Jacky/Ultra%20Driller.png"},{"name":"Jet Ski","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Ranked","path":"/brawlers/jacky/skins/Jacky/Jet%20Ski.png"},{"name":"Jacky Cooky","cost":"149 Gems","campaign":"BT21","path":"/brawlers/jacky/skins/Jacky/Jacky%20Cooky.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/jacky/skins/Jacky/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/jacky/skins/Jacky/True%20Gold.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/jacky/skins/Jacky/"}],"hypercharge":[{"name":"Seismic Event","description":"Holey Moley slows down nearby enemies for 1.5 seconds.","path":"/hypercharges/Seismic%20Event.png"}],"healthByLevel":[5000,5500,6000,6500,7000,7500,8000,8500,9000,9500,10000],"attack":{"name":"Groundbreaker","description":"Jacky hops on her Jackhammer to shake the ground all around.
