Charging it up to around 70% will be sufficient enough to threaten enemies in order to stay at long range.","When the enemy walks in a zig zag pattern to dodge Angelo's shots, consistent damage is more important than dealing high damage, so firing shots charged at about 45% to 55% will help keep his damage output consistent and prevent enemies from healing.","When facing enemies with low health, Angelo can get closer to make sure his fully charged shot hits to defeat the enemy. It is not always necessary to stay very far since his health is fairly high when compared with other marksman Brawlers.","To help teammates finish off enemies, you may get close to enemies to fire his fully charged shot and jump away using his Stinging Flight Gadget.","Since Angelo can easily charge his Super (2 full shots; 3 or 4 hits on average), do not hesitate to leave his Super area when being threatened by enemies.","As Angelo's fully charged shot can deal high damage and even defeat Brawlers with one shot (especially paired with his Super), you should pay attention to when his shot changes in color in order to dodge effectively.","When facing an enemy Angelo, walk in a zig zag pattern with sudden stops so that the enemy will be less likely to hit you."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Angelo","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/angelo/skins/Angelo/Default.png"},{"name":"Elf","cost":"29 Gems","path":"/brawlers/angelo/skins/Angelo/Elf.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/angelo/skins/Angelo/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[3000,3300,3600,3900,4200,4500,4800,5100,5400,5700,6000],"attack":{"name":"Take Aim","description":"Hold the aim to charge up your shots.","stats":{"attackrange":"10 (Very Long)","reload":"0.1 seconds (Very Fast)","attacksupercharge":"5.5%-55% (min to max damage), 0.25% (poison)","attackspeed":"4000","attackwidth":"0.67"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Min.
