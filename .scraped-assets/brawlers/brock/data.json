His rockets are fairly slow and narrow, and the enemies will likely be moving.","Brock performs the best in open maps that don't have a lot of cover so that close-ranged Brawlers couldn't ambush him.","Always keep Brock behind other teammates, because he has fairly low health and is best used for long-ranged support instead.","In Duo Showdown, two Brawlers will most likely be near each other, and Brock's rockets have a small area of explosion when it hits something or when the rocket's range distance ends. Shooting a rocket in between the two Brawlers when they're near will damage both of them greatly. Since his attack's splash radius is also large enough to go through walls slightly, use it to damage enemies extremely close to walls, similarly to Jacky and Squeak's attacks.","Because of Brock's very slow reload time, it's important to make every shot count. Don't fire off all three rockets at once, since that will leave Brock completely defenseless. While his Rocket No. Four Star Power give Brock one additional ammo, it is still worthwhile to maintain your ammo for when you need it.","Use Brock's Super whenever the opponents group up or one is hiding behind a wall.","When using Brock's Super against an enemy, make it count and try to aim it perfectly, as sometimes some Brawlers can escape and deal damage to you when you are still in the duration of the Super.","Brock's Super is great for getting the enemy team to split up as they avoid the rockets so that teammates can deal with them individually.","Brock's Rocket Laces Gadget can be used for briefly getting away from ambushing assassins or tanks. He can also use it to keep distance by jumping over walls or to get close to throwers behind walls.","At close range, Brock can easily defeat lower-health Brawlers by quick-firing 3 rockets. Saving Brock's ammunition and using his Gadget Rocket Laces is especially useful for close-range ambushes.","Brock isn't a viable Brawler to use in Special Events because he has slow reload speed and his Super can break walls, giving the robots a huge advantage in Robo Rumble and Boss Fight.","Use him in Heist to break the walls covering the enemy safe so that he can land burst damage on the enemy safe easily. Also, with his long range, he can deal massive damage to the safe while staying relatively safe from a safe distance as well. His attack's slow projectile speed will not be a disadvantage as the safe is stationary, but enemies might have time to go to the safe and tank some of the shots.","Brock's Super can be used against a wall in front of a goal in Brawl Ball, meaning Brock does not have to go around the wall. He can also use his Rocket Fuel Gadget to break the walls. This applies to all Brawl Ball maps with a wall in front of the goal.","Brock's Rocket Fuel Gadget aids in Brock's area denial. Brock can deal splash damage, but it is rather difficult unless enemies stay within one tile. Making each individual shot count is vital for Brock whose slow reload speed and projectile speed makes him vulnerable once a couple of shots are fired. It also allows Brock to open up walls on the map without having to charge his Super first.","Brock can use Rocket Fuel to break open important walls on the map without needing to charge his Super - a very important tool in maps such as Backyard Bowl or Shooting Star. He can use his Gadget at the start of the match to give his team a huge defensive advantage. One advantage over his Super is that you can better predict the amount of walls Brock's Gadget will destroy as opposed to his Super, which only shows the area-of effect of possible missile hits which is harder to control. However, unlike his super, this shot can be body-blocked by enemies or spawnables (such as the shadows from Tara's Support from Beyond), as the attack does not pierce. However, if your target is standing near their spawnables, the small explosion radius ensures they will still get damaged.","Brock's Rocket No. Four is only good in Knockout because you can easily defeat enemies once you have full ammo."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"03/07/17:","description":"Brock's reload time was decreased to 2.3 seconds (from 2.5).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"11/08/17:","description":"The number of projectiles from Brock's Super was increased to 9 (from 6).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"11/08/17:","description":"His Super also has a larger area of effect.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"04/09/17:","description":"Brock's reload time was decreased to 2.1 seconds (from 2.3).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"04/09/17:","description":"His main attack projectile speed was increased by 5%.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"04/09/17:","description":"His Super spread was made smaller.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"04/09/17:","description":"Brock's rarity was changed to Rare (from Common).","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"12/09/17:","description":"Brock's health was increased to 700 (from 600).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"12/09/17:","description":"His main attack projectile speed was increased by 17%.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"07/12/17:","description":"Brock's Super recharge rate was decreased by 25%.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"07/12/17:","description":"The health and damage statistics of all Brawlers were multiplied by 4.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"07/12/17:","description":"Brock's Incendiary Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"18/12/17:","description":"Brock's Incendiary Star Power damage was increased to 240 (from 160) per second.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"Brock's main attack damage was increased to 1100 (from 1040).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"His main attack projectile size was increased.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"His main attack range was decreased to better fit the screen.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"Every Brawler's movement speed was increased by 70 points, increasing Brock's movement speed to 720 (from 650).","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"All Brawlers' projectile speeds were increased by 9%.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"23/03/18:","description":"Brock's main attack projectile size was decreased by 33%.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"21/05/18:","description":"Brock's rarity was changed to Common (from Rare).","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"05/12/18:","description":"Brock and Beach Brock were remodeled.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"05/12/18:","description":"Beach Brock now costs 80 Gems (from 30).","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"05/01/19:","description":"The Boom Box Brock skin was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"29/01/19:","description":"Brock's Incendiary Star Power damage was increased to 300 (from 240) per second.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"29/01/19:","description":"He was given voice lines.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"31/01/19:","description":"The Lion Dance Brock skin was added.
