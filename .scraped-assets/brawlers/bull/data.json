Take advantage of bushes, obstacles, or thin choke points to ambush and defeat enemies. Therefore, in more open areas or maps, try to dodge enemy attacks. Bull has a higher movement speed than most Brawlers so he can rush enemies and avoid their attacks more easily. It's ideal to dodge enemy attacks and not tank damage, as that allows enemies to quickly charge their Supers.","Bull's Super allows him to charge a very long distance in any direction, destroying all obstacles in his way. Since Bull can deal maximum damage when he's close to his target, this ability can be used for getting Bull close enough to enemies to defeat them. Make sure to aim you Super correctly and predict the enemy's movement, so you can reach the enemy properly to defeat them, or use his Stomper Gadget to get as close as possible to the enemy. Bull's Super can also come in handy when Bull needs to escape from enemies if in danger because of his Super's long charging distance, which is useful in Bounty when overwhelmed by enemies. However, he's not impervious to damage while charging, so be wary of nearby enemies. Also, be careful in Showdown when escaping as his Super's long distance may force you into the poison clouds, however, this can be circumvented with his Stomper Gadget to interrupt his charge.","Bull is very useful in Heist, as he can rush over water and break the obstacles in front of the enemy safe. The opening that he creates by his Super can also be utilized by teammates to attack the safe. He's also viable in the mode with his heavy damage at point-blank range, which can be utilized to destroy the safe easily.","Bull is also effective in Brawl Ball with his high health and Super that destroys obstacles, because he can easily clear openings in the map, assisting his teammates in scoring. He can also self-pass, by kicking the Ball forward and charging towards it, then attempting to score. However, avoid using your Super to make enemies lose the ball by knocking them back, as he can break your team's goalpost and other vital walls, as this only assists the enemies and allows them freely to retrieve the ball and score. Instead, burst your attacks on them at close-range to quickly defeat them with your high damage.","Bull's Berserker Star Power doubles his reload speed, allowing Bull to have the highest overall damage output of any Brawler. Bull can use this power to dominate the robots in Boss Fight and Robo Rumble. Bull is also an ideal Power Cube Carrier in Boss Fight and a solid Brawler in Takedown, as you can use the Power Cubes and Bull's high burst damage to engage the Big Boss, while surviving longer with his T-Bone Injector Gadget and his Tough Guy Star Power and his high health, or to defeat the Boss quicker with his Berserker Star Power and Stomper Gadget, respectively. You can also use this in Heist if you happen to be fairly low on health whilst approaching the safe to incinerate the enemy safe. While he is the Boss in Big Game, you can also use this as an extra boost to his damage output, though being the Boss already boosts your reload speed tremendously.","Bull fares well with throwers who are great at area control such as Barley or Tick, especially in Duo Showdown. They can annoy enemies by placing their mines/bottles everywhere, and Bull, being a Brawler with high health and a high damage output, can quickly finish those enemies off.","Bull's T-Bone Injector Gadget is extremely useful to heal up when in danger, especially if you don't have your Super to escape or don't have healers on your team, and it can also allow you to tank damage effectively.","Use Bull's Stomper Gadget to catch flanking enemies by surprise. Bull's high burst damage will allow him to get shots before an enemy can react. In some cases, Stomper can also cancel Supers that will inadvertently lead you into danger or Supers that enemies have already countered.","Always use T-Bone Injector in Heist, since Bull relies on the length of his Super to reach the Heist safe from a far distance away, so using Stomper is redundant. T-Bone Injector also allows Bull to stay in the fight longer, which allows just enough time to deal a large fraction of the safe's health."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Bull","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/bull/skins/Bull/Default.png"},{"name":"Barbarian King","cost":"Free for Supercell and Clash of Clans' 10th Year Anniversaries","campaign":"Clash Stories","path":"/brawlers/bull/skins/Bull/Barbarian%20King.png"},{"name":"Linebacker","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling, available after purchasing Touchdown Bull","campaign":"Super Brawl","path":"/brawlers/bull/skins/Bull/Linebacker.png"},{"name":"Viking","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","path":"/brawlers/bull/skins/Bull/Viking.png"},{"name":"Touchdown","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","campaign":"Super Brawl","path":"/brawlers/bull/skins/Bull/Touchdown.png"},{"name":"Space Ox","cost":"149 Gems","campaign":"Lunar Brawl","path":"/brawlers/bull/skins/Bull/Space%20Ox.png"},{"name":"Lion","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Club Series","path":"/brawlers/bull/skins/Bull/Lion.png"},{"name":"Bull Mang","cost":"149 Gems","campaign":"BT21","path":"/brawlers/bull/skins/Bull/Bull%20Mang.png"},{"name":"Alleycat","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"License to Brawl","path":"/brawlers/bull/skins/Bull/Alleycat.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/bull/skins/Bull/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/bull/skins/Bull/True%20Gold.png"},{"name":"B-800","cost":"Brawl Pass Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/bull/skins/Bull/B-800.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/bull/skins/Bull/"}],"hypercharge":[{"name":"Jaws of Steel","description":"Bulldozer reduces damage taken by 80%.","path":"/hypercharges/Jaws%20of%20Steel.png"}],"healthByLevel":[5000,5500,6000,6500,7000,7500,8000,8500,9000,9500,10000],"attack":{"name":"Double-Barrel","description":"Bull's double-barreled shotgun deals heavy damage.
