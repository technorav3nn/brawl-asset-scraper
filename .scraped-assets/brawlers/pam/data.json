However, be careful; close-ranged Brawlers with high burst damage such as El Primo, Edgar and Bull, among others can easily defeat you before you can defeat them, due to Pam's very slow attack unload speed. Only try to get close to ranged Brawlers, throwers and Brawlers with low damage.","Charge Pam's Super as quickly as possible and try to keep a heal station on the field at all times to effectively support your teammates and yourself.","Pam is mainly a defensive Brawler, healing teammates while providing cover fire. However, she can also sweep bushes with her attack, though she should be accompanied by another heavyweight or support Brawler.","If you are doing a Showdown battle with the Angry Robo Modifier, you can do Duo Showdown with El Primo and Pam. This is the best way to quickly kill the Angry Robo and rack up power cubes, as they drop 3 when destroyed. Her healing abilities and long range also support El Primo in fights.","Place Pam's healing turret behind walls, as the healing turret's radius passes through walls. This can ensure plenty of healing while keeping the turret itself safe.","Pam's Pulse Modulator Gadget is very useful in emergency situations. If you or a teammate is in need of healing, you can give them or yourself an instant heal to stay alive long enough to win an interaction or escape.","In tight situations, Pam's Super can be quick-fired to serve as an absorbing shield, sacrificing it in the process to increase the chance of escape when being chased, similarly to Ruffs' Take Cover Gadget. However, this should be avoided when you go against Penny's splash damage, Jessie's bounce orbs, or Belle's shots that can still damage Pam when she is behind/around her healing station.","Pam's Mama's Hug Star Power, while not healing much, can still be a useful aspect in keeping teammates alive. Be sure to stay close to them to maximize healing. It is also useful for Pam in 1v1 situations.","Her healing turret is especially useful in Siege. When well-placed in the middle of the map, it allows Pam and her teammates to survive and control the middle to gain more bolts. She can also deal damage to enemies in that area using Mama's Squeeze.","Pam is also very useful in Boss Fight, Robo Rumble and Super City Rampage both for the high damage she can do from a safe range and for her healing turret and Mama's Hug.","Her Mama's Squeeze Star Power can be used to pressure Brawlers hiding behind walls provided that there no throwers on the other team to take out the turret. This very useful in maps like Encirclement where brawlers spend a lot of time behind a central wall.","Pam's Mama's Hug Star Power can easily counter tick damage, such as Crow's poison. If you can consistently land your shots, your health will regenerate faster than Crow's poison decay. The same works against Byron.","Pam can place her healing turret on the Heist safe if she has Mama's Squeeze. This allows her to deal a very high amount of damage in total as the turret will keep dealing damage while it is alive. Coupled with her very fast reload speed and very high damage at close range, she can take out a major portion of the safe's health. Her turret's healing can also protect her other teammates and damage enemies during both offense and defense, making her very good in this mode."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Pam","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/pam/skins/Pam/Default.png"},{"name":"Holiday","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","campaign":"Super City Summers","path":"/brawlers/pam/skins/Pam/Holiday.png"},{"name":"Stonks","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","path":"/brawlers/pam/skins/Pam/Stonks.png"},{"name":"Evil Queen","cost":"299 Gems","campaign":"Once Upon","path":"/brawlers/pam/skins/Pam/Evil%20Queen.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/pam/skins/Pam/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/pam/skins/Pam/True%20Gold.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/pam/skins/Pam/"},{"name":"Healing Turret","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/pam/skins/Healing%20Turret/Default.png"},{"name":"Holiday","campaign":"Super City Summers","path":"/brawlers/pam/skins/Healing%20Turret/Holiday.png"},{"name":"Stonks","path":"/brawlers/pam/skins/Healing%20Turret/Stonks.png"},{"name":"Evil Queen","campaign":"Once Upon","path":"/brawlers/pam/skins/Healing%20Turret/Evil%20Queen.png"},{"name":"True Silver","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/pam/skins/Healing%20Turret/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/pam/skins/Healing%20Turret/True%20Gold.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/pam/skins/Healing Turret/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[4800,5280,5760,6240,6720,7200,7680,8160,8640,9120,9600],"attack":{"name":"Scrapstorm","description":"Pam sprays a large area with bursts of scrap metal.
