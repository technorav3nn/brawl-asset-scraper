Star Power. Prioritize healing over damaging enemies with Poco because Poco's healing can help teammates win many battles and interactions by keeping them alive.","Remember, Poco's attack has a wide spread but doesn't deal much damage. This means he's not used as a front line attacker, but rather used for effective support. Positively, the spread allows him to hit multiple targets at once and charge his Super quickly. The wide spread of his attack also allows him to check large bushes.","When using Poco's Da Capo! Star Power, try lining up his attacks so you can chain them to heal allies and damage enemies simultaneously, similar to how you use Byron's Injection Star Power. This is the best way to get the most value out of Da Capo!, and grants your allies more survivability whilst chipping enemies.","Poco's attacks can be released in quick succession, allowing him to attack an enemy Brawler multiple times to charge his Super quickly before retreating to reload again, or heal a teammate quickly and effectively with his Da Capo! Star Power.","Poco's healing abilities are more useful than Pam's in tight situations when you or your teammates are on low health, as Pam's Super takes time, while Poco's Super is instant and occurs in a much larger area. This makes his healing considerably more useful than that of Pam in offense and survival-oriented modes like Bounty where teammates cannot afford to stay near Pam's turret for long.","Poco with other healers can be insane at healing. Poco could constantly heal Pam and/or Byron and vice versa to stay alive almost indefinitely, or in 3v3 events, two such healers can continuously heal a third teammate while they attack enemies and attempt to gain control of the map.","Poco is amazing when paired up with tanks as Poco can continuously replenish their health while they keep Poco safe from stronger Brawlers and control the map. Using Poco's Tuning Fork Gadget and Poco's Da Capo! Star Power will be more ideal in this case, since with them, Poco can heal allies even without his Super.","It is advised to use his Screeching Solo Star Power when playing Showdown, Lone Star, or Takedown due to the lack of teammates to heal with Da Capo!. This Star Power is especially effective if Poco has his Super charged while standing with multiple low-health enemies. However, Poco is never too viable in such Solo events as he lacks a sufficient damage output and a use for his support abilities.","Even though Poco is a support Brawler, his Screeching Solo Star Power gives him hybrid capabilities, as this Star Power allows Poco to deal damage to enemy Brawlers and heal himself at the same time. Even so, Poco's Super with Screeching Solo should not be used to deal damage in the same manner as his attack. It's also necessary to note that Poco's Screeching Solo damage is quite low, so if the Super's desired motive is to deal damage, it's best to use it to finish off low-health enemies instead of directly damaging enemies."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Poco","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/poco/skins/Poco/Default.png"},{"name":"Pirate","cost":"79 Gems","campaign":"Tales of the Sea","path":"/brawlers/poco/skins/Poco/Pirate.png"},{"name":"Serenade","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"My Brawlentine","path":"/brawlers/poco/skins/Poco/Serenade.png"},{"name":"Trash","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"THE BAD RANDOMS","path":"/brawlers/poco/skins/Poco/Trash.png"},{"name":"CCTV","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Starr Park Origins","path":"/brawlers/poco/skins/Poco/CCTV.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/poco/skins/Poco/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/poco/skins/Poco/True%20Gold.png"},{"name":"Poco Starr","cost":"Brawl Pass Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/poco/skins/Poco/Poco%20Starr.png"},{"name":"Desperado","cost":"Brawl Pass, 149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/poco/skins/Poco/Desperado.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/poco/skins/Poco/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[3700,4070,4440,4810,5180,5550,5920,6290,6660,7030,7400],"attack":{"name":"Power Chord","description":"Poco strums his guitarrón, sending forward bone-jarring sound waves.
