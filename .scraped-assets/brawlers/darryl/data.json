Due to this, retreating/approaching is easier and often safer.","His Super is great for quickly escaping enemies/dangerous situations or getting closer to enemies along with the fact that Darryl rolls extremely quickly and is shielded while rolling. It's also worth noting that you can increase the range of his roll if you happen to roll over water. This is vital when escaping enemies, as the water could help in getting away from tough situations (in maps like Acid Lakes or Canal Grande, etc.).","In Brawl Ball, he can be quite useful by kicking the ball forward and using his Super to roll into and retrieve the Ball. You can use it for retrieving the Ball from the center after either team scores, though it will put him in the middle of the fight and likely results in him being defeated. You can also use his Super on an enemy who's carrying the Ball, which knocks it from their possession and knocks them back. This can be used to defend the goal by delaying an enemy who's about to score.","If timed properly while rolling onto an opponent, Darryl's Super can cancel an enemy's Super due to the knockback, like how Frank's Super can be cancelled with Shelly's Super. This becomes useful when attacking other Brawlers with Darryl who have their Supers ready (like Frank).","Darryl's Super can hit multiple times when fighting in confined areas (which is optimal for Darryl as a tank). Aim his Super to bounce off walls and rack up damage on your enemies.","Using his Super, Darryl can deal significant damage to the IKE turret in Siege by rolling in and shooting at it, taking minimal damage because of the shield he gets from rolling. However, he shouldn't do this in situations where his teammates don't have sufficient control of the Bolt-spawning areas and should instead support his teammates in racking up Bolts.","When confronting enemies at point-blank range, be mindful of your positioning and don't go through them as the second shot of Darryl's attack can completely miss.","Darryl's main attack deals a lot of damage but not consistently. When targeting someone with his Super, make sure he actually rolls into them and hits them. If he's too close, he might roll over them. If he's too far, he can hit them but won't be within bursting range. Tar Barrel's slowing effect allows him to catch up to enemies in case his Super misses by a few tiles.","In maps with a lot of bushes, use Darryl's Recoiling Rotator Gadget to scout out the area. You can find enemies easier that way. The Gadget is also very useful for attacking the enemy safe in Heist. Position yourself right in the center of the safe and activate the Gadget as quickly as possible, rolling clockwise a little to ensure that as many shells as possible hits.","Darryl's Rolling Reload Star Power allows him to ambush and defeat tanks more easily with his Super, because it can drastically increase his damage output. He can also use this to roll onto the enemy safe in Heist and deal extreme amounts of damage. Rolling Reload is also handy if you can't directly hit a Brawler with your Super, allowing you to potentially chip them down from further away with your increased reload speed. It also helps when you desperately need to roll onto someone but have no ammo left.","Darryl's Steel Hoops Star Power can act as a secondary shield in numerous situations. He can use it to roll onto enemies normally so he's shielded while attacking them after rolling or use it in Siege to stay alive longer while attacking the IKE in Siege.","Hitting a brawler with the edge of Darryl's Super can momentarily knock them back, and Darryl can deal significant damage while they are still knocked back."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"07/12/17:","description":"Darryl was added to the game.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"18/12/17:","description":"Darryl's health was increased to 4600 (from 4400).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"18/12/17:","description":"His Steel Hoops Star Power damage reduction was increased to 80% (from 70%).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"18/12/17:","description":"His Super roll speed decreased slightly to 2400 (from 2800).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"18/12/17:","description":"His main attack shots are fired a bit closer together.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"22/12/17:","description":"Darryl's movement speed was increased to 700 (from 650).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"16/01/18:","description":"Darryl's health was increased to 5000 (from 4600).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"16/01/18:","description":"Darryl's main attack damage was increased to 360 (from 320) per shell.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"27/01/18:","description":"The number of hits necessary to charge Darryl's Super was increased to 13 hits (from 10).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"Every Brawler's movement speed was increased by 70 points, increasing Darryl's base movement speed to 770 (from 700).","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"All Brawlers' projectile speeds are increased by 9%.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"21/05/18:","description":"Darryl's reload time was decreased to 1.8 seconds (from 2).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"05/12/18:","description":"The number of hits necessary to charge Darryl's Super was decreased to 11 hits (from 13).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"05/12/18:","description":"Darryl's Super now charges automatically over 20 seconds.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"05/12/18:","description":"Darryl's Steel Hoops Star Power shield now lasts for 3.5 seconds.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"05/12/18:","description":"Darryl's health was decreased to 4000 (from 5000).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"05/12/18:","description":"His main attack damage was decreased to 260 (from 360) per shell.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"05/12/18:","description":"His Super damage was decreased to 400 (from 640) per hit.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"05/12/18:","description":"His Super range was decreased to 7 tiles (from 23.3).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"05/12/18:","description":"Darryl's Steel Hoops Star Power damage reduction was decreased to 30% (from 80%).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"29/01/19:","description":"His main attack damage was increased to 280 (from 260) per shell.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"29/01/19:","description":"Darryl's Steel Hoops Star Power damage reduction was increased to 40% (from 30%).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"29/01/19:","description":"Darryl was slightly remodeled.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"31/01/19:","description":"The Dumpling Darryl skin was added.
