This is useful for chipping away at enemies that normally out-range Fang's kick, not to mention that it charges as much of his Super as his kick. He can use this mechanic to charge his Super and travel towards enemies.","Try to utilize Fang's super better, try to super on to a tank so you chain and land on a sharpshooter, this is way more effective than ending your super on a tank.","Fang's Super travels quickly, so it's useful for collecting Gems in Gem Grab or the Bolts in Siege, similar to Carl's Flying Hook Gadget.","Fang's Corn-Fu Gadget is a great area denial ability, but it can also be used to deal additional damage to enemies fairly close to him.","Fang's Fresh Kicks Star Power allows Fang to recharge his Super when defeating an enemy. This is especially useful against clumps of low-health enemy Brawlers.","Though Fang's Super is most notable for its ability to chain on targets, it can be used for a normal kill as he can travel towards an enemy and defeat them with his kicks, or as an escape when Fang's on low health.","Fang's Super is similar to Bull's Super, but much faster and doesn't knockback. Take advantage of enemy tanks to bounce off them and hit lower health Brawlers, like throwers.","Don't be too aggressive while playing Fang, as he'll be very vulnerable along with the fact that he has a slow unload speed. Instead, try and target one enemy at a time and retreat to heal up afterwards.","Before using his Super on higher-health Brawlers, make sure that you have a good amount of health because he is most likely to get hit by enemy attacks as he cannot dodge while using his Super.","With Fang's Roundhouse Kick Gadget, Fang can now guarantee a kill easily. Try to take out the most important enemy such as the Gem carrier.","Fang's Super is similar to Colette's Super, as it doesn't go directly toward where you aimed, so be aware or else you can Super into a wall.","Fang's Roundhouse Kick Gadget and Super both reset his attack delay. A good strategy is to use the Super, then attack, then stun, then attack once more. This strategy allows you to do a ton of damage really quickly.","When you use your super, try to first use your shoe attack, then right away use your super. This will have your super charged again faster, so that you can use it to get away and heal, or to make another kill."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Fang","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/fang/skins/Fang/Default.png"},{"name":"Octo","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","campaign":"Deep Sea League","path":"/brawlers/fang/skins/Fang/Octo.png"},{"name":"Kabocha","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Supercell Make","path":"/brawlers/fang/skins/Fang/Kabocha.png"},{"name":"Ferocious","cost":"149 Gems","campaign":"Lunar Brawl","path":"/brawlers/fang/skins/Fang/Ferocious.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/fang/skins/Fang/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/fang/skins/Fang/True%20Gold.png"},{"name":"Furious","cost":"Brawl Pass Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/fang/skins/Fang/Furious.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/fang/skins/Fang/"}],"hypercharge":[{"name":"Dragon Kick","description":"Charge through walls while dropping popcorn on the way.","path":"/hypercharges/Dragon%20Kick.png"}],"healthByLevel":[4300,4730,5160,5590,6020,6450,6880,7310,7740,8170,8600],"attack":{"name":"Wu-Shoe","description":"Fang unleashes a swift kick with a hidden trick.
