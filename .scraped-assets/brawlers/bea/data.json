If it's glowing red (for enemies) or blue (for you/allies), that shows a supercharged shot is ready.","Bea has only one ammo slot and low health, so she can be ambushed easily. It is advised not to stay too close to bushes that cover a large area like in Cavern Churn, because close-ranged Brawlers and assassins such as Shelly, Bull, Darryl, Edgar, or Crow can be great counters and can inflict lots of burst damage if they have been bush-camping or behind walls nearby, and assassins can dodge your shots easily with their fast movement speed and/or fast Supers (i.e. Stu).","Since Bea's Super can slow down enemies, she can use it to escape from enemies who are chasing her. She can also use it to slow down enemies who are trying to escape from her.","Since Bea's Super spreads out, it is great for checking bushes when you know an enemy brawler is hiding, but the area the bush covers is too large for her normal attack.","Note that Bea's shot will only supercharge her next shot if it hits an enemy Brawler or Bosses in certain events; hitting anything else, such as Showdown crates, the Heist safe, the Siege IKE turret, and minions such as Scrappy and Nita's bear will not supercharge her next shot.","Take into consideration that while it only takes four attacks to charge Bea's Super, her normal shot and supercharged shot have the same Super charge.","Usually, most Brawlers are fast enough to be able to dodge Bea's shots. However, upon hitting a Brawler with her Super, it is possible to auto-aim them down very quickly without aiming as the Brawler is slowed down and unable to move fast enough to dodge her shots. Keep in mind that Brawlers with movement speed boosts from Star Powers or Supers might still be able to dodge auto-aimed shots.","It is advisable to place Bea's Honey Molasses Gadget behind a wall in order to make it harder for enemies to destroy the beehive, as it only has 1000 health. Alternatively, you can use it as a shield to tank some damage if you find yourself in a desperate situation where you need to escape quickly with their remaining health. This can also slow down chasing Brawlers, helping you escape.","Bea's Rattled Hive Gadget is very unpredictable and hard to dodge if players are dealing with other threats. Because the bees move faster and do more damage at a longer range, it is more advisable to use this Gadget offensively for massive area denial and damage potential than to use it defensively. It can also be used to check bushes that are behind walls and damage throwers hiding behind walls.","Bea’s Super projectiles spread out in a wide cone, which allows them to hit enemies around walls. It's useful for discouraging enemies from afar and defeating enemies that are close to you."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"18/12/19:","description":"Bea was added to the game.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"01/01/20:","description":"Bea's Honey Coat Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"04/01/20:","description":"The Ladybug Bea skin was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"23/01/20:","description":"Bea's Honey Coat Star Power shield duration was decreased to 0.6 seconds (from 1).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"23/01/20:","description":"Her class was changed to Sharpshooter (from Sniper).","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"19/02/20:","description":"Bea's Honey Coat Star Power shield duration was increased to 1 second (from 0.6).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"19/02/20:","description":"Her Honey Coat Star Power now triggers only once per match (from once per spawn).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"17/03/20:","description":"Bea's Honey Molasses Gadget was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"07/04/20:","description":"Bea's main attack projectile speed was increased by 5%.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"13/05/20:","description":"Bea's Honey Molasses Gadget slow area was increased by 20% and now drops above Bea.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"24/07/20:","description":"The Mega Beetle Bea skin was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"30/10/20:","description":"Bea's Rattled Hive Gadget was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"15/12/20:","description":"The bees spawned by Rattled Hive are now closer together.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"14/01/21:","description":"Bea's Rattled Hive bee damage was decreased to 800 (from 1000) per bee.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"27/01/21:","description":"Mega Beetle Bea's facial animations were reworked.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"08/02/21:","description":"Bea's Rattled Hive Gadget bee count was increased to 4 (from 3).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"08/02/21:","description":"The bees' damage was decreased to 600 (from 800) per bee.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"08/02/21:","description":"The bees now stop at the first target hit.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"08/02/21:","description":"The bees' fly pattern changed slightly to move slower and cover less area.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"15/03/21:","description":"Bea's second Star Power was renamed to Honeycomb (from Honey Coat) and reworked from retaining 1 health and gaining an immunity shield before defeat once per match to giving her a 20% shield when her attack is supercharged.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"15/03/21:","description":"Bea's texture colors were made slightly more saturated.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"29/04/21:","description":"The Neko and the Gold Neko Bea skins were added.
