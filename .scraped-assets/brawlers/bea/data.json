If it's glowing red (for enemies) or blue (for you/allies), that shows a supercharged shot is ready.","Bea has only one ammo slot and low health, so she can be ambushed easily. It is advised not to stay too close to bushes that cover a large area like in Cavern Churn, because close-ranged Brawlers and assassins such as Shelly, Bull, Darryl, Edgar, or Crow can be great counters and can inflict lots of burst damage if they have been bush-camping or behind walls nearby, and assassins can dodge your shots easily with their fast movement speed and/or fast Supers (i.e. Stu).","Since Bea's Super can slow down enemies, she can use it to escape from enemies who are chasing her. She can also use it to slow down enemies who are trying to escape from her.","Since Bea's Super spreads out, it is great for checking bushes when you know an enemy Brawler is hiding, but the area the bush covers is too large for her normal attack.","Note that Bea's shot will only supercharge her next shot if it hits an enemy Brawler or Bosses in certain events; hitting anything else, such as Showdown crates, the Heist safe, the Siege IKE turret, and minions such as Scrappy and Nita's bear will not supercharge her next shot.","Take into consideration that while it only takes four attacks to charge Bea's Super, her normal shot and supercharged shot have the same Super charge.","Usually, most Brawlers are fast enough to be able to dodge Bea's shots. However, upon hitting a Brawler with her Super, it is possible to auto-aim them down very quickly without aiming as the Brawler is slowed down and unable to move fast enough to dodge her shots. Keep in mind that Brawlers with movement speed boosts from Star Powers or Supers might still be able to dodge auto-aimed shots.","It is advisable to place Bea's Honey Molasses Gadget behind a wall in order to make it harder for enemies to destroy the beehive, as it only has 1000 health. Alternatively, you can use it as a shield to tank some damage if you find yourself in a desperate situation where you need to escape quickly with their remaining health. This can also slow down chasing Brawlers, helping you escape.","Bea's Rattled Hive Gadget is very unpredictable and hard to dodge if players are dealing with other threats. Because the bees move faster and do more damage at a longer range, it is more advisable to use this Gadget offensively for massive area denial and damage potential than to use it defensively. It can also be used to check bushes that are behind walls and damage throwers hiding behind walls.","Bea’s Super projectiles spread out in a wide cone, which allows them to hit enemies around walls. It's useful for discouraging enemies from afar and defeating enemies that are close to you.","Bea will actually take longer to shoot her next shot if you spam the aim button. Instead, wait for the shot to reload and instantly press the attack button. This may take practice but will overall boost your damage per second."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Bea","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/bea/skins/Bea/Default.png"},{"name":"Ladybug","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/bea/skins/Bea/Ladybug.png"},{"name":"Neko","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","campaign":"Golden Kawaii","path":"/brawlers/bea/skins/Bea/Neko.png"},{"name":"Archvillain","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","campaign":"Supercell Make","path":"/brawlers/bea/skins/Bea/Archvillain.png"},{"name":"Mega Beetle","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Robots & Monsters","path":"/brawlers/bea/skins/Bea/Mega%20Beetle.png"},{"name":"Gold Neko","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Golden Kawaii","path":"/brawlers/bea/skins/Bea/Gold%20Neko.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/bea/skins/Bea/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/bea/skins/Bea/True%20Gold.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/bea/skins/Bea/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[2400,2640,2880,3120,3360,3600,3840,4080,4320,4560,4800],"attack":{"name":"Big Sting","description":"Bea sends out a long range shot that, upon landing, supercharges her next shot to deal epic damage!","stats":{"attackrange":"10 (Very Long)","reload":"0.9 seconds (Very Fast)","attacksupercharge":"26%","attackspeed":"3255","attackwidth":"1"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage","list":[800,880,960,1040,1120,1200,1280,1360,1440,1520,1600]},{"name":"Supercharged Damage","list":[2000,2200,2400,2600,2800,3000,3200,3400,3600,3800,4000]}]},"super":{"name":"Iron Hive","description":"Bea deploys a swarm of drones that move and turn like jets.
