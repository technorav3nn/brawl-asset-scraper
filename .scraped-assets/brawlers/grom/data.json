You must be aware of its placement since it can be easily destroyed along with the fact that it already loses health over time, so make sure to place it out of reach from most enemies.","The best way to use Grom's Foot Patrol Star Power is to chase enemies since his Super can be devastating. You can bring an enemy to low health with his attacks while charging his Super in the process, chase them, and throw his Super at the right time.","Enemies will likely walk diagonally in an attempt to dodge Grom's attack. Try to force enemies towards wall clusters where they are restricted and burst them down.","Remember that enemies will move in an attempt to dodge Grom's attacks. With Grom's X-Factor Star Power, keep this in mind, as if they move and fail to dodge the attack, they take extra damage.","With Grom's Radio Check Gadget, it's best to use it on targets that aren't moving, like the Heist safe. It can also be used for map control as enemies would naturally be wary of getting in your range. This can cause devastating damage and high value as it effectively fires three attacks for the cost of one ammo.","Try and learn how the knockback works on Grom's super: once this is learnt, you can use it as a combo with his Radio Check Gadget. Aim the Gadget at where the enemies will be knocked back to. This is very effective as enemies will be unable to dodge the Gadget as they are being knocked back by the Super. If done correctly, it can deal over 5000 damage."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Grom","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/grom/skins/Grom/Default.png"},{"name":"Bunny","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","campaign":"Bunny Brigade","path":"/brawlers/grom/skins/Grom/Bunny.png"},{"name":"FrankenGrom","cost":"149 Gems","campaign":"Brawl-o-ween","path":"/brawlers/grom/skins/Grom/FrankenGrom.png"},{"name":"Dasis","cost":"199 Gems","campaign":"Warrior's Journey","path":"/brawlers/grom/skins/Grom/Dasis.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/grom/skins/Grom/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/grom/skins/Grom/True%20Gold.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/grom/skins/Grom/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[2800,3080,3360,3640,3920,4200,4480,4760,5040,5320,5600],"attack":{"name":"Bud Go Boom!","description":"Grom hurls Bud, his exploding walkie-talkie!
