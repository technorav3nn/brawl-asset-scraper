This can be utilized in maps like Parallel Plays and Backyard Bowl. One way is to aim a Super at a choke point near your goal so that when an enemy with a ball triggers it, they cannot shoot the ball and their only option is to walk it in, buying your team a bit of time to stop the goal.","Otis' Super can be used against brawlers with the immunity shield because it's preventing them to attack while they have a shield, and if he doesn't use it on the enemy, they can kill him before you can attack the enemy.","His Super can prevent enemies from passing the ball in Brawl Ball and Basket Brawl. This can be a useful way to prevent enemies from scoring a goal efficiently.","Otis is an insane defender in Heist, as he can stop aggro brawlers like El Primo when they get close to the safe by muting them and then killing him. As an offender, with his Ink Refills Star Power and his Phat Splatter Gadget paired, Otis can deal high damage to the safe.","With Otis' Ink Refills Star Power and his Phat Splatter Gadget paired, he can do a lot of DPS against enemies or the safe in Heist.","In bushy maps like Snake Prairie, Otis' Gadget Phat Splatter combined with Stencil Glue can cover a lot of bushes and can see an enemy with Otis' super on for 4 seconds.","Try to put your Super on close range, because it helps Otis to defeat the enemy faster."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"29/06/22:","description":"Otis became available to play in the Training Cave.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"04/07/22:","description":"Otis and his Pharaotis skin were added to the game.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"14/07/22:","description":"Fixed an occasional server error when using Otis' Super and his Gadget.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"25/07/22:","description":"Otis' Phat Splatter Gadget was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"08/08/22:","description":"Otis' Ink Refills Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"31/08/22:","description":"Otis' Dormant Star Gadget can now be activated without requiring his Super.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"31/08/22:","description":"Fixed a bug that played the incorrect voice line when unlocking Otis.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"31/08/22:","description":"Otis' True Silver and True Gold skins were added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"19/09/22:","description":"Otis' main attack damage was increased to 460 (from 420) per ink drop.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"19/09/22:","description":"Otis' Super now deals 340 (from 0) damage per second and recharges his Super.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"19/09/22:","description":"Fixed a server error in specific circumstances when playing Otis.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"12/12/22:","description":"Otis' main attack damage was decreased to 440 (from 460) per ink drop.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"12/12/22:","description":"The number of hits necessary to charge Otis' Super was increased to 13 hits (from 12).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"28/02/23:","description":"Otis' health was decreased to 3200 (from 3400).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"28/02/23:","description":"Otis' class was changed to Controller (from Damage Dealer).","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"14/04/23:","description":"The Oni Otis skin was added.
