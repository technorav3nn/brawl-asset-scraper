This can be utilized in maps like Parallel Plays and Backyard Bowl. One way is to aim a Super at a choke point near your goal so that when an enemy with a ball triggers it, they cannot shoot the ball and their only option is to walk it in, buying your team a bit of time to stop the goal.","Otis' Super can be used against brawlers with the immunity shield because it's preventing them to attack while they have a shield, and if he doesn't use it on the enemy, they can kill him before you can attack the enemy.","His Super can prevent enemies from passing the ball in Brawl Ball and Basket Brawl. This can be a useful way to prevent enemies from scoring a goal efficiently.","Otis is an insane defender in Heist, as he can stop aggro brawlers like El Primo when they get close to the safe by muting them and then killing him. As an offender, with his Ink Refills Star Power and his Phat Splatter Gadget paired, Otis can deal high damage to the safe.","With Otis' Ink Refills Star Power and his Phat Splatter Gadget paired, he can do a lot of DPS against enemies or the safe in Heist.","In bushy maps like Snake Prairie, Otis' Gadget Phat Splatter combined with Stencil Glue can cover a lot of bushes and can see an enemy with Otis' super on for 4 seconds.","Try to put your Super on close range, because it helps Otis to defeat the enemy faster."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Otis","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/otis/skins/Otis/Default.png"},{"name":"Oni","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"The Ayakashi Clan","path":"/brawlers/otis/skins/Otis/Oni.png"},{"name":"W","cost":"149 Gems","campaign":"World Champions 2023","path":"/brawlers/otis/skins/Otis/W.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/otis/skins/Otis/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/otis/skins/Otis/True%20Gold.png"},{"name":"Pharaotis","cost":"Brawl Pass, 149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/otis/skins/Otis/Pharaotis.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/otis/skins/Otis/"},{"name":"Cil","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/otis/skins/Cil/Default.png"},{"name":"Oni","campaign":"The Ayakashi Clan","path":"/brawlers/otis/skins/Cil/Oni.png"},{"name":"W","campaign":"World Champions 2023","path":"/brawlers/otis/skins/Cil/W.png"},{"name":"True Silver","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/otis/skins/Cil/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/otis/skins/Cil/True%20Gold.png"},{"name":"Pharaotis","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/otis/skins/Cil/Pharaotis.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/otis/skins/Cil/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[3200,3520,3840,4160,4480,4800,5120,5440,5760,6080,6400],"attack":{"name":"Inky Art","description":"Otis squirts a burst of ink drops from his spray gun arm.","stats":{"attackrange":"9 (Long)","reload":"1.5 seconds (Normal)","attackbullets":"3, 4 (with Ink Refills), 1 (with Phat Splatter)","attacksupercharge":"8.03%, 8.833% (with Super Charge Gear)","attackspread":"11°","attackspeed":"3600","attackwidth":"1.33 (with Phat Splatter)"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage per paint blob","list":[460,506,552,598,644,690,736,782,828,874,920]}]},"super":{"name":"Silent Seabed","description":"Otis flings Cil who grabs onto the first enemy hit and prevents them from attacking for a short while.","stats":{"superrange":"9 (Long)","supersupercharge":"8.5%, 9.35% (with Super Charge Gear)","superspeed":"3200","superwidth":"1.33","superduration":"3 seconds, 4 seconds (with Stencil Glue)"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage per second","list":[340,374,408,442,476,510,544,578,612,646,680]}]},"model":{"path":"/brawlers/otis/model.png"},"avatar":{"path":"/brawlers/otis/avatar.png"}}
