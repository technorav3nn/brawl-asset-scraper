Because of this, you also shouldn’t attack an enemy if you’re in danger of dying and running away from them. To deal damage to an enemy without making yourself vulnerable, try to ambush them one on one from the bushes, so they won’t have much time to react.","It's best to be patient when considering Frank's Super. Frank's average range and poor mobility mean that he works best on maps with lots of walls, so using his Super too much may result in him having a much harder time landing attacks. This is especially important in Brawl Ball, as opening up the map can make it much easier for the enemy team to score.","Frank’s range is relatively short, but if you’re chasing a long-ranged Brawler or playing him on an open map where long-ranged Brawlers are popular such as Shooting Star in Bounty, don’t attack until your range is within the enemy and use Frank’s above-average movement speed to dodge the enemy’s shots. You should also use his Sponge Star Power if playing him on an open map, because it enables him to get to enemies without dying easily. Even so, he is most viable in maps or events with a plethora of obstacles to fight and ambush enemies in close quarters such as Cavern Churn in Showdown, Brawl Ball, and Hot Zone.","In Brawl Ball, Frank can charge his Super easily at the beginning of a round due to how close each Brawler spawns near each other, and then break the goalpost and other goal obstacles to make scoring much easier. For the same reason, since his Super charges up easily (3 hits), he can Super the Ball into the goal easily. These abilities along with his very high health (allowing him to survive longer), his Trait, his above-average movement speed and his Active Noise Cancelling Gadget make him very viable in this event and make him an ideal Ball carrier.","In Siege, Frank is useful because he can stun the enemy team and prevent them from obtaining Bolts. He can also stun the enemy IKE and allow his team and the Siege Bot to attack it safely but temporarily. He can also stun the enemy Siege Bot and hinder it from attacking the team IKE. With his Trait, he can easily charge his Super from enemies and carry out the above strategies. His high health and fast movement speed make him ideal for obtaining Bolts, or a tank for lower-health teammates to get control of the Bolt spawns.","Frank is also useful in Gem Grab, because stunning the enemy team is also effective, allowing for control of the Gem mine and allows his allies to collect Gems at ease. He can also stun the enemy Gem carrier and easily defeat the enemy if they’re escaping while holding Gems. He’s also decent as the Gem carrier, because he can hold Gems easily with his high health, and he can use his Super to stun enemies who are chasing him (in which damaging Frank is detrimental to the enemies because of his Trait, in which Frank can charge his Super quicker and stun them), therefore preventing them from defeating him.","Frank is niche in Hot Zone, because he can stay in the zones longer and control the zones thanks to his enormous health pool and his high damage output. With his relatively fast Super charge rate (3 hits) and his Trait, he can stun the enemies and render them completely vulnerable to fire as they can’t hold their ground in the zones and can be defeated easily.","When your Super and your attacks are charged, use your Super to stun enemies first, and hold them still while you eliminate them with your attacks, and because they’re stunned, they can’t provide counter fire. If used correctly, it can allow you and your team to wipe out the enemy/enemy team.","Frank is effective against longer-ranged Brawlers if he dodges their shots, but is extremely effective against tanks and other-close-ranged Brawlers such as El Primo and Rosa, because he deals high damage to the close-ranged Brawlers because they need to maintain point-blank range of him in order to damage him.","A great composition when playing Duo Showdown or Brawl Ball is Frank with Tara. Once both of you have your Supers charged, then this strategy works. First, look for a group of enemy players. Tara should pull in all the enemies in range, while Frank stuns them, hindering them greatly.","If possible, use Frank’s Active Noise Canceling Gadget before performing his Super to prevent enemies from cancelling it with their disruptive abilities. Additionally, you can also use your Trait to hinder disruptive abilities. Allow your enemy to charge both yours and the enemy’s Supers, then allow the enemy to use their disruptive Super, then use your Super on the enemy and defeat them with your attacks, while the enemy can’t provide counter fire or cancel your Super with their attack after wasting their Super (except for Lou and Bibi). You should especially use these strategies on Shelly, because her ability to chain her Super could greatly hinder Frank.","Frank does moderately good in Big Game as a Hunter because he can still deal high damage even though his Super’s stun is ineffective against the Big Boss. However, when he is the Big Boss, Frank dominates, because he can deal massive damage to enemies, which is better justified with his Power Grab Star Power, and he can use his Super to stun enemies, therefore preventing them from defeating him.","Frank's Irresistible Attraction Gadget can be used right after his Super to pull the enemies towards him so he can finish them off. If timed correctly, he can also use it to either pull enemy defenders away from the ball or to free up some space to score a goal more easily in Brawl Ball.","Since he has the highest amount of health of any Brawler, he and Ruffs work well together, as Colonel Ruff’s Field Promotion Star Power and Super boosts Frank’s health and damage output drastically. However, be aware of Colette since she can deal incredible amounts of damage to Frank due to his boosted health.","Frank is also ideal in Hold the Trophy. His fast movement speed allows him to catch up to the trophy easily, and the slowing effect from the trophy won’t affect him much. Due to Frank’s extremely high health, he can easily hold the trophy and can withstand countless attacks from enemies. As a defender of the trophy holder, he’ll ruthlessly deal high damage to enemies, and he can stun the enemies, hindering them from receiving the trophy or defeating the team’s trophy holder.","Frank is also viable in Takedown. With his fast movement speed, he can pick up Power Cubes and catch up to the Boss easily and can deal massive damage to the Boss and continuously with his fast reload speed, and he can withstand countless attacks from the Boss with his already high health and the boosted health from the Power Cubes.","Frank is useful for Robo Rumble because he has high health, and he can out-damage and defeat the melee and mini robots while his teammates defeat the sniper robots. He can use his Super to stun the big robot and he can use his Irresistible Attraction Gadget to pull the big robot away from the safe, therefore hindering the big robot. Frank also doesn’t need to stress about ammo consumption because of his incredibly fast reload speed, so he can consistently defend. His Super should be used carefully late-game, however, because it destroys obstacles and leaves the safe open for robots to attack it.","If possible, charge up your Super and use it to stun an enemy who’s taking cover behind an obstacle. The Super deals sufficient damage while stunning the enemy, and it also destroys the obstacle, rendering it completely useless to the enemies in the future.","Some Brawlers have abilities that can cancel Frank's Super such as Shelly's Super or El Primo's Suplex Supplement Gadget. Take caution when using Frank's Super near these Brawlers to avoid wasting your Super."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Frank","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/frank/skins/Frank/Default.png"},{"name":"Caveman","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","path":"/brawlers/frank/skins/Frank/Caveman.png"},{"name":"DJ","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","path":"/brawlers/frank/skins/Frank/DJ.png"},{"name":"Holiday Party","cost":"149 Gems","campaign":"Brawlidays","path":"/brawlers/frank/skins/Frank/Holiday%20Party.png"},{"name":"Spirit Knight","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Supercell Make","path":"/brawlers/frank/skins/Frank/Spirit%20Knight.png"},{"name":"Vanara","cost":"199 Gems","campaign":"Warrior's Journey","path":"/brawlers/frank/skins/Frank/Vanara.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/frank/skins/Frank/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/frank/skins/Frank/True%20Gold.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/frank/skins/Frank/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[7000,7700,8400,9100,9800,10500,11200,11900,12600,13300,14000],"attack":{"name":"Hammer Hit","description":"Frank takes a while to wind up his hammer blow, but the hit is so hard it sends a shockwave.","stats":{"attackrange":"6 (Normal)","reload":"0.8 seconds (Very Fast)","attacksupercharge":"37.2%","attackspread":"65°","attackspeed":"5000"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage","list":[1240,1364,1488,1612,1736,1860,1984,2108,2232,2356,2480]}]},"super":{"name":"Stunning Blow","description":"Frank's greatest hit sends a shockwave that destroys environment and stuns enemies for a while.","stats":{"superrange":"7 (Long)","supersupercharge":"37.2%","superspread":"65°","superspeed":"6000"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage","list":[1240,1364,1488,1612,1736,1860,1984,2108,2232,2356,2480]}]},"model":{"path":"/brawlers/frank/model.png"},"avatar":{"path":"/brawlers/frank/avatar.png"}}
