When the bubble is at its maximum size, rotate the attack joystick to aim towards the enemy, and release quickly. This strategy catches the enemy off-guard as they will not be able to gauge a safe distance from you while your bubble is not facing them."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"05/06/23:","description":"Hank became available to play in the Training Cave.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"06/06/23:","description":"Fixed an issue that resulted in Hank dealing inconsistent damage values.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"07/06/23:","description":"Hank and his Shark Tank skin were added to the game.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"12/06/23:","description":"Hank's health was decreased to 5000 (from 6000).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"12/06/23:","description":"Hank's main attack damage was decreased to 450 (from 500) at minimum charge.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"12/06/23:","description":"Hank's Super charge rate now scales with the damage dealt.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"12/06/23:","description":"Fixed Hank's Super damage scaling when upgrading him.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"12/06/23:","description":"Fixed a bug that caused Hank's Super to deal extra damage at close range.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"12/06/23:","description":"Fixed a bug where Hank was dealing too much damage with Power Cubes or outside buffs.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"12/06/23:","description":"Fixed an issue with Hank's voice lines when receiving damage.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"27/06/23:","description":"Hank is now visible when charging up his main attack in an invisible area.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"27/06/23:","description":"Hank can no longer heal from auto-regeneration while charging his attack.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"27/06/23:","description":"The number of hits necessary to charge his Super was increased to 5 hits (from 3) at maximum charge.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"27/06/23:","description":"Hank's It's Gonna Blow Star Power speed boost was decreased to 10% (from 20%).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"15/08/23:","description":"Hank's health was increased to 5400 (from 5000).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"15/08/23:","description":"Hank's Super damage was increased to 1320 (from 1000).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"05/09/23:","description":"Hank's health was increased to 5800 (from 5400).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"05/09/23:","description":"Hank's main attack damage was increased to 525 (from 450) at minimum charge.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"05/09/23:","description":"The number of hits necessary to charge his Super was decreased to 4 hits (from 5) at maximum charge.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"05/09/23:","description":"All Brawlers' health and damage were increased from 5% to 10% with each Power Level.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"16/09/23:","description":"The Rodeo Hank skin was added.
