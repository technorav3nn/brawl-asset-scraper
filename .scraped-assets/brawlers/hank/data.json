When the bubble is at its maximum size, rotate the attack joystick to aim towards the enemy, and release quickly. This strategy catches the enemy off-guard as they will not be able to gauge a safe distance from you while your bubble is not facing them."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Hank","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/hank/skins/Hank/Default.png"},{"name":"Shark Tank","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/hank/skins/Hank/Shark%20Tank.png"},{"name":"Rodeo","cost":"199 Gems","campaign":"Wasteland","path":"/brawlers/hank/skins/Hank/Rodeo.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/hank/skins/Hank/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[5800,6380,6960,7540,8120,8700,9280,9860,10440,11020,11600],"attack":{"name":"Balloon Blast","description":"The longer you hold, the deadlier the blast.","stats":{"attackrange":"3.33 (min. range), 4.67 (max. range)","reload":"0.25 seconds (Very Fast)","attacksupercharge":"6.5625%-26.25% (min to max range)"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Min. damage","list":[525,577.5,630,682.5,735,787.5,840,892.5,945,997.5,1050]},{"name":"Max. damage","list":[2100,2310,2520,2730,2940,3150,3360,3570,3780,3990,4200]}]},"super":{"name":"Fish Torpedo","description":"Hank launches Fish Torpedoes in all directions.","stats":{"superrange":"20 (Very Long)","superbullets":"6","supersupercharge":"28.71%","superspread":"360Â°","superspeed":"4000","superwidth":"0.67"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage per torpedo","list":[1320,1452,1584,1716,1848,1980,2112,2244,2376,2508,2640]}]},"model":{"path":"/brawlers/hank/model.png"},"avatar":{"path":"/brawlers/hank/avatar.png"}}
