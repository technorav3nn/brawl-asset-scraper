Thus, if you find yourself on low health in the Shadow Realm, try to go to a more secluded place to retreat so that enemy Brawlers can't ambush you when your Super ends.","Thanks to his enhanced speed in the Shadow Realm, Cordelius can use his Super to \"teleport\" to other ends of the map unseen by enemy Brawlers, making him useful for getting to objective zones such as the Heist Safe or Hot Zone.","In a pinch, Cordelius' Super coupled with his Star Power Mushroom Kingdom can be used as a last-minute resort to heal, allowing him to slip past enemy Brawlers undetected while grabbing mushrooms to heal.","Thanks to his Trait and Super, Cordelius is well suited to guard places where enemy standoffs tend to occur, where he can camp behind a wall and charge his Super before using it and chasing the enemy Brawler away.","While Cordelius' Super prevents enemies from using Gadgets or their Supers, do note that Brawlers with Gadgets that modify their attacks retain the effects when transported to the Shadow Realm, making them more of a hassle to deal with.","However, although his Poison Mushroom Gadget cannot be activated in the Shadow Realm, if Cordelius activates the Gadget before entering the Shadow Realm, his next attack will still preserve the Gadget's effect even in the Shadow Realm.","Cordelius' Super can be used as an emergency escape if he is low on health, and his enhanced speed helps him outpace the enemy he sent to the Shadow Realm and heal before his Super ends. This can be more effective with his Mushroom Kingdom Star Power.","Cordelius can remove an enemy instantly, which is useful in Brawl Ball. For example, you can use the Super at the goalkeeper while kicking the ball into the goal.","Be careful however, as you won't be able to defend your goal either.","Multiple Brawlers can be in the Shadow Realm at the same time. This can be helpful when a teammate is transported by an opposing Cordelius.","Keep in mind that if one of the two Brawlers that entered the Shadow Realm together is defeated by a third party, the other one will still remain there until defeated or until their time is out.","Furthermore, it's advised for one not to send another Cordelius to the Shadow Realm as all Cordeliuses present will receive buffs no matter whose Super they were affected by, essentially negating any advantage you'd have."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Cordelius","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/cordelius/skins/Cordelius/Default.png"},{"name":"Poison Cap","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/cordelius/skins/Cordelius/Poison%20Cap.png"},{"name":"Raider","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Wasteland","path":"/brawlers/cordelius/skins/Cordelius/Raider.png"},{"name":"Sporemind","cost":"Brawl Pass Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/cordelius/skins/Cordelius/Sporemind.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/cordelius/skins/Cordelius/"}],"hypercharge":[{"name":"Complete Darkness","description":"Cordelius slows down his targets when sending them to the Shadow Realm.","path":"/hypercharges/Complete%20Darkness.png"}],"healthByLevel":[3200,3520,3840,4160,4480,4800,5120,5440,5760,6080,6400],"attack":{"name":"Mushrooms","description":"Cordelius shoots two mushrooms with his gardening tool, damaging enemies on hit.","stats":{"attackrange":"5.33 (Normal)","reload":"1.2 seconds (Very Fast), 0.84 seconds (with Super)","attackbullets":"2, 1 (with Poison Mushroom)","attacksupercharge":"19.1625%","attackspeed":"3800","attackwidth":"0.67"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage per mushroom","list":[730,803,876,949,1022,1095,1168,1241,1314,1387,1460]}]},"super":{"name":"This Is My Domain","description":"Cordelius shoots a Shadow Mushroom that passes through walls and on hit transfers the target and him to the Shadow Realm for 8 seconds.
