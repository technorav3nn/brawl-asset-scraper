Use obstacles to get as close as possible to enemies and unleash your attack that has the potential to defeat all but tanks or brawlers with heavy shields.","If you're stuck at long range, you can use the strafing technique to chip out a moderate amount of the enemy's health. Similar to Bo, Leon's projectiles are fired from left to right, so you can concentrate or spread out by strafing left or right while attacking. You can walk left while shooting to narrow his attack width and increase his damage. Conversely, you can walk right while attacking to get a wide attack with minor damage for finishing off your enemies.","In Heist, Leon's Super allows him to sneak behind the enemies to attack the enemy safe on the other side of the map.","Leon is decent in Bounty. His Super allows him to pick off enemies and defeat them one by one, racking up huge amounts of stars for his team. However, Leon is not effective at eliminating more than one enemy, so he could find himself in a disadvantageous position after eliminating an enemy.","Leon's Super is ineffective when used near an enemy when they know your path. Using his Super when hiding in bushes can make your escape route increasingly unpredictable: by doing this, enemies have a hard time finding him after firing at the now unoccupied bushes.","Leon's Super can be used both offensively and defensively. If you're in a bad position, you can use your Super to sneak away from the enemy or even defeat one of them. If you are carrying a lot of Gems in Gem Grab or have a high bounty in Bounty, use your invisibility to escape, making it hard for the opposition to attack you.","You can flash your Super as you walk into a bush to trick your enemies into thinking that you've gone invisible. This allows you to heal up in the bush whilst your enemies scan the arena, thereby wasting their ammo.","Leon's blades have a deceptively long range and a spread that widens as they travel. Chip away at enemies and build up your Super before slipping into stealth to defeat Brawlers at close range. This strategy works well in Events where you have to eliminate enemies, such as Bounty, Showdown, or Knockout.","Conserving ammo is also particularly more important with Leon. His relatively slow reload speed makes him vulnerable to an enemy who has managed to dodge, survive Leon's attacks, or both.","Both of Leon's Star Powers are really useful for Brawl Ball. His Smoke Trails Star Power allows him to snatch the Ball quickly while enemies are unsuspecting of Leon's presence until Leon retrieved the Ball and attempts to score, while Invisiheal can grant Leon an exceptional survivability boost which allows him to withstand much more damage from multiple enemy defenders who are present at their goal.","Unlike most assassins, Leon is used for eliminating one enemy at a time and does not have the potential for multi-defeats because of his slow reload and non-piercing attack.","In Showdown, Leon has two options for play styles: one is a Roamer and the other is a Third Party. Roamers (like Crow, Darryl, etc.) walk around the map searching for potential targets to pick them off one by one. Third Parties (like Mortis or Crow) search for two people who are already engaged in combat and wait (preferably in a nearby bush) till one of the two is defeated. The Third Party then finishes off the winning Brawler and collects both Power Cube batches.","Leon's Smoke Trails Star Power grants him an incredibly fast movement speed for the Super's duration, making him incredibly hard to hit. This is also useful for making quick getaways or to engage someone faster.","Leon's Invisiheal Star Power heals him a lot every second for 6 seconds (unless you attack before the Super's duration ends, which is not recommended with this Star Power). This is preferable over Smoke Trails in game modes like Gem Grab, Showdown, and Siege, where Leon might need to collect power-ups or objectives while staying invisible and also healing if detected. Invisiheal also allows you to dodge meteors or other potentially deadly threats in Showdown. When using Leon's Invisiheal Star Power, try activating his Super right before an engagement. Waiting to attack once in close proximity using your Super while the enemy unloads their shots and while you heal for 1000 health per second gives Leon the ammo and health advantage to win more battles in close quarters.","Leon's Clone Projector Gadget can prove to be incredibly useful in some situations, i.e. against a Shelly or Colt with their Super. They'll probably fire their Super at the clone, effectively wasting it. Don't try this when on low health, because your clone replicates the amount of health you have and the fact that it's charging at a person gives it away. A strategy you can do with it is to go into a bush, pop your Gadget, and then turn invisible for an ambush to finish off low-health Brawlers who will probably waste their ammo on your clone. Leon's Clone Projector can also chase the closest enemy even when they're inside a bush, letting Leon detect if the bushes have enemies. It can also be used as a meat shield to absorb damage from enemies with a non-piercing, bouncing, or splitting attack.","If necessary to step into the poison gas in Showdown, you can quickly escape a close fight using Leon's Invisiheal Star Power. The poison gas does less damage to Leon than the Invisiheal Star Power heals, allowing him to use his Super to get away from a tough situation. However, the poison's damage will build up over time, so you eventually will have to leave the gas (also note that Invisiheal can only heal up to 6000 health before the Super ends).","If you ever use Leon's Super out in the open, use it while walking one way and immediately turn around and sneak up from another side. This makes it less predictable in where you'll come from.","Leon's Lollipop Drop Gadget can provide a lot of value in 3v3 Events as its invisibility range can allow you and your teammates to walk across otherwise separated bushes, and placing it behind walls will make it harder for most enemy Brawlers to destroy it.","Don't waste Leon's Super as it is most important to him since he can easily achieve kills with it. For example, if you're on low health and there is a high-burst damage Brawler near you, don't use his Super even if you have his Invisiheal Star Power as that Brawler will defeat you anyway. However, if the scenario is in Showdown, use your Super to escape and/or either one of the Gadgets as a meat shield (since they're both spawnables).","As the clone produced by the Clone Projector Gadget can reveal bushes around it, it's ideal to use it to scout out the area for any enemies. This is especially useful if the opponents are low on health and retreating, as they would likely panic-fire at the clone, wasting their ammo, stalling their healing and allowing the real Leon to take them out.","Enemies can spot Leon from 4 tiles away, however they can only spot enemies hiding in bushes from 2 tiles away. This can help Leon detect enemies nearby if he is invisible while hiding in bushes. Leon will be notified by a small yellow eye icon if an enemy is at least 4 tiles away while invisible, but they still won't see him while within the bushes. Keep in mind that this won't work with Brawlers who can see invisible enemies."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"05/12/18:","description":"Leon was added to the game.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"07/12/18:","description":"Leon is now visible to enemy Brawlers within 4 tiles of him if Leon is invisible.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"29/01/19:","description":"Leon's main attack damage was decreased to 460 (from 500) at close range per blade.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"29/01/19:","description":"His Super duration was decreased to 8 seconds (from 10).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"27/02/19:","description":"Leon's main attack damage was decreased to 440 (from 460) at close range per blade.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"27/02/19:","description":"The number of hits necessary to charge his Super was increased to 9 (from 8) at close range.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"15/04/19:","description":"Leon's Super duration was decreased to 7 seconds (from 8).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"15/04/19:","description":"Leon's attack projectiles were retextured.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"31/07/19:","description":"Leon's Invisiheal Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"29/08/19:","description":"Leon's Invisiheal Star Power healing was increased to 800 (from 600) per second.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"13/09/19:","description":"The Shark Leon skin was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"18/09/19:","description":"Leon's Super invisibility now doesn't work against IKE turrets.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"23/10/19:","description":"Leon's Invisiheal Star Power healing was increased to 1000 (from 800) per second.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"23/10/19:","description":"Leon's Super duration was decreased to 6 seconds (from 7).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"23/10/19:","description":"He was given voice lines.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"31/10/19:","description":"The Werewolf Leon skin was added.
