Always try to manually aim your main attack when using Nani.","Pay attention to enemies with canceling capabilities like knockback, pull, and stun. If Nani is moved from Peep's original casting spot, Peep will disappear. Also note that Peep can't be directly destroyed; however, it can be interrupted by walls, immunity bubbles, pets, etc. When using Nani's Super, wait for the target to either lose their shield or use their pet when going against an enemy with any of these.","Before using Nani's Super, hide away from any enemies, preferably in bushes, then use her Super. Never use Nani's Super when she's in the middle of a battle, as it leaves Nani vulnerable to enemy attacks. Although this weakness can be alleviated with Nani's Star Power Tempered Steel to shield her, Nani is still vulnerable to being knocked back or stunned which will cause her Super to disappear without exploding.","Nani's Gadget Warp Blast can be used to reach the enemy safe in Heist, enemy's territory in Trophy Thieves, and the Ball in Brawl Ball more quickly.","To hit enemies accurately with Nani, try to lead your shots slightly ahead of them, meaning if they're walking away from you, you'd shoot slightly above them.","Unless within close range of an enemy Brawler, never auto-aim your Super because of the fact that it goes towards the nearest enemy. The direction it will go in may cause you to struggle to control Peep. Try to manually aim your Super so that it starts off in the direction that you want it to go, then control Peep with your movement joystick.","Because of Nani's unique attack pattern, her shots can be fired at enemies camping behind walls, although normally only 1 of the 3 orbs will hit an enemy. If possible, you can use the unique diamond path of the two outer orbs to hit an enemy behind a wall.","Nani, having very high damage per attack if all orbs hit, and a similarly high damaging Super that can also knock back enemies who get too close, is a very effective tank counter. To make use of this ability, the best way to kill tanks, especially heavyweights, is to maintain a medium range of around 4-5 tiles from the enemy, which allows Nani to hit her shots easier without giving the enemy time to dodge them, while also staying just out of the range of their high damaging attacks. If they get close enough to you, use your Super to knock them back and deal extra damage. Don't be afraid to get close to them, however, if they are low on health, as you can find it hard to kill a skilled dodger at a range.","Tempered Steel essentially quintuples her health, allowing her to escape or hide when coupled with Warp Blast, such as in Big Game. Overall, Nani's Super puts her in a very vulnerable position, but the shield provides enough value to deter enemies. Not bursting Nani down completely during its duration allows her to potentially two-shot enemies near her without fear of repercussions.","You can use Nani's Super as an additional attack when you are in close-quarters with a short-ranged Brawler. This can be very useful as hitting enemies with Peep deals damage and knockbacks, allowing you to escape.","Tempered Steel is extremely strong in Super City Rampage and Siege as she can take a lot of hits from the Mega Monster or robot, and she can take even more when a Brawler like Pam or Poco is healing her.","Try not to activate her Return To Sender Gadget when you are near to a Brawler which shoots multiple low damage projectiles, such as Colt, Pam, etc. You will only return a little bit of damage to the enemy Brawler if you use this Gadget against an enemy like this. Only use it when you're going to take one-time high damage, such as Dynamike's Super, another Nani's Super, a Piper bullet or a supercharged Bea shot. This requires some practice and fast reflexes but if utilized well, it can be game-changing. If you can't properly apply Nani's Return to Sender Gadget in adequate time, you can use it as a temporary 80% shield for one projectile.","Do not use the Return To Sender Gadget when you are using the Tempered Steel Star Power especially when it is activated, as the Star Power would decrease the amount of the damage Nani receives, the effectiveness of the Gadget will be reduced significantly."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"29/05/20:","description":"Nani became available to play in the Training Cave.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"05/06/20:","description":"Nani became available to play in matches.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"16/06/20:","description":"Nani's reload time was decreased to 1.8 seconds (from 2).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"16/06/20:","description":"Fixed a bug which allowed Nani to teleport with the ball in Brawl Ball.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"17/06/20:","description":"Nani's Tempered Steel Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"02/07/20:","description":"Nani's health was increased to 2600 (from 2400).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"02/07/20:","description":"Her main attack projectiles now travel extra distance if she miss her target for improved damage dealing consistency.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"02/07/20:","description":"Her main attack effect now better matches the area where the damage is dealt.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"14/08/20:","description":"The Retro Nani skin was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"27/11/20:","description":"The Sally Nani skin was added.
