However, unlike her Super, her main attacks don’t go through walls and open space is required for these tactics to work.","When using her Super, try to damage enemies behind walls so that you can damage them while they're unable to do so. This strategy, however, can circumvent when facing throwers such as Barley or Tick who can still attack you regardless of walls in the way.","As another Brawler, if Emz is chasing you, don't run away from her. Instead, get close to her to defeat her because the more time you stay in her gas, the more damage you'll take, so if you are close to her you’ll take less damage. One good example is Mortis, if you know how to dash, you can easily approach Emz without taking too much damage and quickly take her down. Be warned that experienced players will save their Super and Friendzoner Gadget to counter this tactic, therefore more caution is needed when using other Brawlers to get close to Emz.","Emz can deal the most damage in mid-long range so don't approach close-ranged Brawlers where they would have an advantage over you. In Bibi's case, however, you can use her knockback against her, which is opportunistic provided that you survived Bibi's knockback attack, and then you can spam your lingering spray, which will force Bibi to retreat.","When using Emz's Super, try to position so that the enemy is near the edge of your Super range. This way, when you attack, the enemy will be slowed and forced to suffer from all 3 ticks of your attack.","Emz is very effective at mid-long range. Try to keep the enemy you are attacking at about 2/3 of the attack range, as this causes the enemy to take the full amount of 3 ticks of damage. However, if the enemy is in very close proximity to you, you’ll only be able to deal 1 tick of damage, and if the enemy is at the far range of your attack, it’ll only do two. This makes Emz very vulnerable to close-ranged Brawlers who get close enough to her, especially airborne Brawlers like El Primo and this requires her to use her Friendzoner Gadget to distance her from such Brawlers.","Emz is a great control Brawler in Gem Grab, Brawl Ball and especially Hot Zone due to her lingering attack. Use Emz to push your enemies to the opposing side while consistently collect gems in Gem Grab, keep enemies slowed down when they’re carrying the Ball in Brawl Ball or cover an area of the zone for a long time in Hot Zone.","Emz can be useful when chasing down low-health Brawlers since her lingering attack can stack up to massive amounts of damage and her Super can slow down Brawlers who are escaping. This attribute is beneficial during desperate situations in Bounty, Brawl ball, Hot zone or Gem Grab.","Emz's attack speed is fast enough for her to fire another hairspray cloud before her previous attack has fully dissipated. The damage from both attacks stack on top of each other, effectively doubling her damage per tick. However, she reloads slowly, so try not to waste shots in the excitement of dealing high burst damage.","Perhaps the largest weakness Emz has is that she cannot deal sufficient damage if a Brawler is close to her. Her Friendzoner Gadget covers this weakness. If an enemy Brawler is in close-quarters with you, you can use it to push them back. However, it’s less useful against Brawlers with Supers that allow them to move such as Bull as they can re-approach you.","Despite its small range and radius, Emz's Friendzoner Gadget can be used to either knock the Ball out of a Brawler's grasp in Brawl Ball, cancel Frank's, Carl’s, or Meg's Super(s) or, in Showdown, push enemies into the poison gas if positioned accurately.","Emz can fire an attack at an enemy close to her and then use her Friendzoner Gadget immediately afterwards to push the enemy into the lingering area of her attack. While it requires very precise timing, this can cause enemies to take one extra tick of damage, which is beneficial in defeating enemies faster.","Emz with her Hype Star Power should use her Super when she can hit multiple enemies, as if she does so, her healing multiplies and keeps her alive for even more time than she would normally be. This encourages you even more to tackle multiple enemies if they're close to each other, already given her attack's area damage and lingering mechanics. She can perform team-wipes easily as she can rapidly charge her Super and heal significantly, helping her succeed even when outnumbered.","Emz is better in open maps with ample space, so you should play her in maps like Massive Attack or Skull Creek, where her Super can maintain area control and her attack has an advantage in the moderately spaced field.","Try to avoid engaging Buzz, as he’s a major counter to Emz. His Super can stun Emz and pull him towards her, allowing Buzz to easily eliminate her, and despite his short range, his Trait enables him to charge his Super passively, which allows him to play passive around obstacles to charge his Super. If you’re facing Buzz and have Emz's Friendzoner Gadget, you can carefully time when Buzz uses his Super, and if he does end up latching onto you, push him away once he's moderately close to you, cancelling his Super and knocking him back into your attack's range.","Similar to Gene using his Lamp Blowout Gadget to score in Brawl Ball, you can also try this strategy by scoring with your Friendzoner Gadget. Firstly, get directly close to the enemy goal’s side walls, which should have enemy defenders blocking the goal. If you have the Ball, immediately kick it towards the nearest enemy, because the enemy should be carrying it in order for this to work. Then, use your Friendzoner Gadget to push the enemy back, which knocks the Ball out of their grasp, and if you’re near the side wall, it’ll push the Ball into the goal unless an enemy is inside the goal to circumvent this strategy and block the Ball.","The Friendzoner gadget is also helpful for maps with a lot of bushes like Island Invasion from Showdown to save your life. When you come across an enemy into the bushes and want to get away from them, use the gadget and attack, and Emz will be safe from losing health points."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Emz","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/emz/skins/Emz/Default.png"},{"name":"Mean Girl","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","campaign":"Brawl Academy","path":"/brawlers/emz/skins/Emz/Mean%20Girl.png"},{"name":"Harajuku","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","campaign":"Golden Kawaii","path":"/brawlers/emz/skins/Emz/Harajuku.png"},{"name":"Super Fan","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Gift Shop","path":"/brawlers/emz/skins/Emz/Super%20Fan.png"},{"name":"DJ 3.M.Z","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Supercell Make","path":"/brawlers/emz/skins/Emz/DJ%203.M.Z.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/emz/skins/Emz/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/emz/skins/Emz/True%20Gold.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/emz/skins/Emz/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[3600,3960,4320,4680,5040,5400,5760,6120,6480,6840,7200],"attack":{"name":"Spray","description":"Emz gives you a blast of her hair spray!
