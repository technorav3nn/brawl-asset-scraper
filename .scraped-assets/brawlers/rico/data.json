If they're hiding in bushes, move side-to-side while shooting off of the wall to cover more ground with your bullets.","Because Rico can bounce his shots off of walls, which increases each bullet's range for every bounce, he's outstanding on enclosed maps such as Cavern Churn whereas other sharpshooters would have difficulty hitting shots due to the abundance of walls.","Though difficult to perform, Rico can chain his Super if every bullet from his Super successfully hits an enemy Brawler. This is more practical if Rico hits several enemies in a single Super.","Rico's Super Bouncy Star Power grants his bullets an extra 124 damage upon bouncing. While it doesn't seem like much additional damage for each bullet, when all five bullets are bounced, an additional 620 damage is added, making his total damage 2860. Similarly, a bounced Super will deal a total of 6864 damage. This encourages Rico to bounce shots off of walls for them to deal more damage (especially in maps like Snaked Assault and Turnaround) where he has the potential to bounce his shots from a safe distance. However, don't shoot Rico's Super directly onto a target and expect the bullets to deal damage to the target again when they bounce off of another wall, as his Super's bullets only deal damage once, and to properly use this Star Power, you must bounce the Super off of a wall in such a way that the bounced shots hit the target and not the normal shots.","Rico's Robo Retreat Star Power allows Rico to perform guerrilla tactics by rushing into fights and then escaping when you're on low health. Doing so allows more of your bullets to hit enemies due to the increased accuracy. If you're a good sniper, you should back away from fights and attack from a distance. If you're a good dodger, you can keep firing to prevent Rico from healing and stay below 40% health to use the speed buff to dodge enemy fire and even outrun fast Brawlers like Mortis and Crow.","Rico is an outstanding asset for Special Events. In these modes, he can provide continuous fire to the robots with his high damage and very fast reload speed while staying out of danger by attacking the robots around walls. His Robo Retreat Star Power is also useful when waiting for teammates to respawn or to outrun the Boss and its attacks. In addition, his piercing and high-damaging Super allows him to significantly damage the robots.","Rico's Multiball Launcher Gadget deals high damage if all of the bullets hit. However, it's very inconsistent as the bullets spread out from him, so it's best to use this Gadget at point-blank range so all of the bullets can hit a target. However, this Gadget is mainly used in an enclosed area where the bullets will bounce multiple times and guarantee a hit to an enemy trapped in the area.","Rico's Bouncy Castle Gadget makes bouncing shots off of walls a necessity due to the healing applied to each bounce, and the healing can assist him in modes like Bounty where one's intent is to secure defeats without being defeated. It's extremely useful when you're on low health and hitting an enemy behind a wall, as it can heal you while damaging the enemy. However, in order to heal significantly, you'll need to bounce the bullets off of multiple walls, so it's never wrong to use the Gadget in the intention of healing and not damaging enemies, given Rico's very fast reload speed."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Rico","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/rico/skins/Rico/Default.png"},{"name":"Ricochet","cost":"Free from Brawlidays 2019 gift","campaign":"2019 Anniversary","path":"/brawlers/rico/skins/Rico/Ricochet.png"},{"name":"Loaded","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/rico/skins/Rico/Loaded.png"},{"name":"Popcorn","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Starrs of Brawlywood","path":"/brawlers/rico/skins/Rico/Popcorn.png"},{"name":"Guard","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Sands of Time","path":"/brawlers/rico/skins/Rico/Guard.png"},{"name":"Chicken","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Club Series","path":"/brawlers/rico/skins/Rico/Chicken.png"},{"name":"Final Boss","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Ranked","path":"/brawlers/rico/skins/Rico/Final%20Boss.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/rico/skins/Rico/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/rico/skins/Rico/True%20Gold.png"},{"name":"Firefly","cost":"Brawl Pass, 79 Gems or 2750 Bling","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/rico/skins/Rico/Firefly.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/rico/skins/Rico/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[2800,3080,3360,3640,3920,4200,4480,4760,5040,5320,5600],"attack":{"name":"Bouncy Bullets","description":"Rico's bullets bounce off walls, gaining range.
