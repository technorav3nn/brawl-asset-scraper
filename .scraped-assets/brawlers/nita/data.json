Take advantage of this when enemies gather close together.","Nita's Super can be thrown over walls, so it can come in handy for dealing with enemies that are hiding behind one. You can use the Bear Paws Gadget in these situations too to get more value off of Bruce and potentially defeat the enemies hiding behind a wall.","Bruce has moderately high health, allowing Nita to create her own tank. The bear distracts enemies and absorbs fire, protecting Nita and giving her a chance to deal damage.","Bruce can also detect Brawlers hidden in bushes and pursue them. This can help Nita and her teammate/s locate hiding enemy Brawlers, effectively making it a scouting tool.","Since Nita's Super is a thrown projectile like Barley's attacks, it will summon the bear quicker if thrown toward an area closer to Nita. This is convenient when you are being attacked by a shotgun-wielding Brawler such as Shelly or Bull since the bear can tank the projectiles, allowing Nita to escape and counterattack.","Nita's bear has a very short attack range, so it is best if supported or used in an enclosed area where the enemy will be unable to get past the bear.","Nita can use her Super to spawn the bear on a launch pad to ambush unsuspecting enemy Brawlers.","Avoid hiding behind her bear when facing a Penny or Jessie since the splash attack will have a huge effect on Nita.","Use Nita's Super to bolster an aggressive push on Gem Grab, allowing your team to take control of the mine. The bear can either take damage for your team, wasting the enemy's ammunition, or weaken the enemy.","The bear is useful in Heist where you can throw the bear past enemies and walls to attack the safe. Nita's Hyper Bear Star Power is especially useful in Heist.","If she ever gets too close to melee Brawlers, use her Super to distract heavyweights like Darryl or Bull so there is ample time to escape.","When facing a Brawler with non-piercing attacks, place Bruce a few tiles (or right in front of you) to make them waste their ammo on Bruce, while you and Bruce can effectively finish them off.","Nita's bear can effectively prevent the enemy it is chasing from healing up. The enemy will either have to attack, stopping or preventing natural healing, or get damaged, out of which the enemy will most likely choose the former. This can be used to pressure a weakened Gem carrier or other crucial opponent into getting easily defeated by Nita and her team.","Nita’s Bear Paws Gadget can come into great effect if you have her Hyper Bear Star Power. Nita will be able to stun enemies and charge her Super again extremely fast, which can be useful against high-health Brawlers. However, it also works with her Bear with Me Star Power, allowing the bear to catch up to enemies and heal Nita more.","When facing an enemy Frank, always have the Bear Paws Gadget ready to cancel Frank’s Super when he’s about to stun you, Bruce, and your teammates. This will not only cancel Frank’s Super in the process, therefore defusing it, but also give ample time for teammates to defeat Frank.","Faux Fur's shield greatly increases Bear with Me's effectiveness. In Heist, using it with her Hyper Bear Star Power may be more favorable. In general, only use Hyper Bear in non-Heist modes when she is using Bear Paws. Bear with Me provides more consistent value in these cases."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Nita","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Nita/Default.png"},{"name":"Panda","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Nita/Panda.png"},{"name":"Koala","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Nita/Koala.png"},{"name":"Whale Watch","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","campaign":"Supercell Make","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Nita/Whale%20Watch.png"},{"name":"Red Nose","cost":"149 Gems","campaign":"Brawlidays","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Nita/Red%20Nose.png"},{"name":"Shiba","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Golden Kawaii","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Nita/Shiba.png"},{"name":"Nian","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Power League","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Nita/Nian.png"},{"name":"Tusked","cost":"299 Gems","campaign":"Bizarre Circus","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Nita/Tusked.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Nita/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Nita/True%20Gold.png"},{"name":"Gummybear","cost":"Brawl Pass, 79 Gems or 2750 Bling","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Nita/Gummybear.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Nita/"},{"name":"Bear","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Bear/Default.png"},{"name":"Panda","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Bear/Panda.png"},{"name":"Koala","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Bear/Koala.png"},{"name":"Whale Watch","campaign":"Supercell Make","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Bear/Whale%20Watch.png"},{"name":"Red Nose","campaign":"Brawlidays","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Bear/Red%20Nose.png"},{"name":"Shiba","campaign":"Golden Kawaii","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Bear/Shiba.png"},{"name":"Nian","campaign":"Power League","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Bear/Nian.png"},{"name":"Tusked","campaign":"Bizarre Circus","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Bear/Tusked.png"},{"name":"True Silver","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Bear/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Bear/True%20Gold.png"},{"name":"Gummybear","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Bear/Gummybear.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/nita/skins/Bear/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[4000,4400,4800,5200,5600,6000,6400,6800,7200,7600,8000],"attack":{"name":"Rupture","description":"Nita sends forth a shockwave, damaging enemies caught in the tremor.","stats":{"attackrange":"6 (Normal)","reload":"1.1 seconds (Very Fast)","attacksupercharge":"20.9%","attackspeed":"2718","attackwidth":"1.67"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage","list":[960,1056,1152,1248,1344,1440,1536,1632,1728,1824,1920]}]},"super":{"name":"Overbearing","description":"Nita summons the spirit of Big Baby Bear to hunt down her enemies.","stats":{"superrange":"5","supersupercharge":"10%","superspeed":"1196","superminionrange":"2","superminion":"Bear","supermovementspeed":"610","superreload":"0.6 seconds, 0.24 seconds (with Hyper Bear)"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Bear Health","list":[4300,4730,5160,5590,6020,6450,6880,7310,7740,8170,8600]},{"name":"Bear Damage","list":[400,440,480,520,560,600,640,680,720,760,800]}]},"model":{"path":"/brawlers/nita/model.png"},"avatar":{"path":"/brawlers/nita/avatar.png"}}
