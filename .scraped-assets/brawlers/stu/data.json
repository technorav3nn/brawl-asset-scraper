Stu can use his Super to dodge an attack once, get another hit that recharges his Super, and use the Super again to escape unharmed.","Stu is outstanding in Brawl Ball/Trophy Thieves/Volley Brawl/Basket Brawl because of his high mobility with his Super. In addition, Stu can self-pass by kicking the ball/trophy ahead and dashing forward to retrieve it back, then continuously hitting the enemies from afar to recharge and chain Supers so he can dash towards the ball/trophy.","Stu’s Speed Zone Gadget should be kept behind obstacles so it’s protected from enemies. He can also use it at the team’s spawn point of the map to help him and his allies get back into action after being defeated or as a temporary shield to block shots from enemies that can’t hit multiple targets.","When Stu’s Super is auto-aimed, he dashes in the direction that he is facing. Thus, auto-aiming is useful to escape from enemies chasing you or to engage long-ranged Brawlers by dashing randomly and dodging their shots.","Stu can poke effectively by using his Super, his fast unload speed, and his attack’s fast Super charge rate. He can fire a shot at an enemy, then dash backwards to avoid their counter fire. This recharges Stu's Super if the shot lands, which allows him to continuously poke, and once they’re low on health, you can use your Super to get close to them and burst your attacks to finish them off.","Stu’s Super makes him an outstanding counter to close-ranged Brawlers because Stu can hit them once and dash away and out of their range, and then attack them with ease. Use this to your advantage when facing close-ranged Brawlers.","Stu’s Zero Drag Star Power makes self-passing the ball in Brawl Ball and dodging shots easier and makes opponents harder to hit while dashing around. It also allows him to collect vital items such as Siege Bolts faster, to reach a certain area of the map faster, or to better counter close-ranged Brawlers as he can dash out of their range more effectively.","Stu’s fast Super charge rate, his high mobility with his Super, and his quick burst attacks make him niche in offense-oriented modes such as Bounty. However, Stu's attack doesn’t pierce, so he does best in a 1v1 situation where he can continuously poke at the enemy and dodge their attacks.","With his Gaso-Heal Star Power, Stu can use his attack and Super in quick succession to quickly heal up in a pinch because of his fast Super charge rate and fast unload speed. You can dash around and heal and use this as an alternative to self-regeneration.","Stu is decent in Big Game because he can dash around and dodge enemy fire, and he can burn the enemies with his Super as the Big Boss. As a Hunter, he can use his Speed Zone Gadget for enhanced mobility and he can continuously poke the Big Boss while dashing unpredictably and quickly.","Stu is solid in Hot Zone. He can hit the enemies from afar and use his Super to dash towards zones. In addition, his quick burst attacks and his Super that allows him to dodge enemy fire make him a deadly and hard to hit target while fighting and allows him to gain better control of the zones.","Stu’s Breakthrough Gadget is helpful as it can destroy obstacles. He can use it to defeat enemies who are taking cover behind obstacles or to destroy the goalpost in Brawl Ball to score goals at ease.","Stu can actually get two supers from one attack. If you attack an enemy and the first projectile lands, there is a small window for you to use your super before the second projectile hits, essentially granting a free second super. This is tricky to pull off though.","Although Stu has the easiest super to charge in the game, it is still very important to make sure you always have a super ready. this way you are always prepared, and can escape more situations. You can try to conserve supers by only using it when you know you can get another shot off, or after you have started to shoot and you think it will connect.","With Stu's Zero Drag star power, he can escape a direct Edgar jump. with some follow up shots and supers, you should be able to easily defeat an enemy Edgar. Keep this in mind in solo showdown.","Although a niche technique, you can use Stu's breakthrough gadget as a way to escape, if your path is blocked by a wall. this is mostly useful if you get ambushed by a close range brawler near a wall.","If you use Stu often, consider making your gadget button much bigger, as. you will need to activate both gadgets very quickly. This only applies to the speed zone gadget if you are planning on using it as a meat shield."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"15/03/21:","description":"Stu and his Superstar skin were added to the game.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"31/03/21:","description":"Stu's Gaso-Heal Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"07/04/21:","description":"Stu's health was decreased to 3000 (from 3200).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"07/04/21:","description":"Stu's main attack damage was decreased to 580 (from 600) per shot.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"22/04/21:","description":"Stu's health was decreased to 2800 (from 3000).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"16/06/21:","description":"Stu’s Super can no longer knock enemies back.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"15/07/21:","description":"Stu's Breakthrough Gadget was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"18/08/21:","description":"The Wicked Stu skin was added.
