However, be careful when using her Super, as it destroys walls and bushes, which could prove fatal to teammates or Shelly herself if they need to take cover or to hide.","When using Shelly, take advantage of walls or bushes when approaching long-range Brawlers such as Colt or Rico (for Rico, try to avoid having a large assortment of walls by and behind you that he could bounce his projectiles on, which gives him an obvious advantage), since they can out-range and take down Shelly with ease in the open. To avoid that, be careful when using her Super, as it destroys walls, which gives her an obvious disadvantage against long-ranged Brawlers like the mentioned.","The spread of Shelly's attacks allows her to sweep bushes and expose any enemies hiding in them without having to go inside the bush, potentially risking being defeated by a high-damage Brawler like Bull.","Similar to Colt's Super, projectiles from Shelly's Super don't pierce through walls, they disappear after breaking one. Keep this in mind if you are trying to use Shelly's Super to defeat a Brawler behind a wall, because the opponent will take less damage due to some of the bullets disappearing after breaking a wall; the more walls between you and your enemy (in a scenario where the Super is aimed perfectly at the opponent), the less damage they'll take from the Super.","Shelly is an excellent counter to tanks with her Super, since she can chain Supers on the tanks and stun-lock them, making them unable to fight back. However, Shelly is helpless in close-quarters combat without her Super due to the tanks’ superior health and DPS, so try to have your Super charged up before facing them.","Shelly's Super has the ability to interrupt other Brawlers' Supers because it knocks them back. For example, she can stop Frank from using his Super if she hits him with her Super during his wind-up. This can become even more deadly by waiting in a bush and then ambushing, since the enemies won't know you're there and won't be careful when using their Super, giving you an opportunity to surprise them, stopping their Super and potentially defeating them.","As mentioned, Shelly is capable of chaining her Super. This is done by using her Super against an enemy Brawler at point-blank range. This will charge her Super such that she needs only one more main attack to have her Super ready again, allowing her to move on to the next Brawler to repeat the process, gaining and using Supers in quick succession. This proves to be an effective counter against tanks except for Bull and Darryl.","If Shelly is at low health and is being chased by a Brawler, she can use her Super to knock them back and gain a bit more time to escape. This works even better if she has Shell Shock since, that way, she can also slow them down for a few seconds. If both of these don't help or she doesn't have her Super, Shelly can also use her Fast Forward gadget.","Defeating assassins with Shelly can be tricky. To defeat such Brawlers, use your Fast Forward Gadget to get closer to the long-range assassins and defeat them at close-quarters. However, this is circumvented if the respective assassin escapes, such as Stu with his Super. For close-range assassins, focus on landing your shots correctly to quickly defeat them.","Shelly's Clay Pigeons Gadget can be used directly after using her Super at mid-range. While the enemy gets knocked back, Shelly is able to hit all bullets with the longer attacks provided by the Gadget to get maximum value out of it. This is especially effective when combined with her Shell Shock Star Power, allowing Shelly to easily land even more shots and take down foes, usually getting her Super back in the process, which could help her in a later combat.","Shelly's Clay Pigeons Gadget channels and increases the range of her shots for a couple seconds, making it easier to charge Supers that could help in later combats. In mirror matches or against medium-range Brawlers, this can be helpful, but her Fast Forward Gadget can give Shelly more advantage. It allows her to get in close range to enemies and ambush them, potentially surprising them if she dashes from a bush. Sometimes, though, you will find yourself using Clay Pigeons in situations where an enemy on low health is out of your normal range and you need to finish them off (like when they have a lot of gems in Gem Grab or to secure a quick elimination in Bounty or Knockout, which could potentially give your team a victory).","Using her Shell Shock Star Power, Shelly can slow down Brawlers that are trying to escape, allowing her and/or her teammates to catch up and eliminate them. In Showdown, this can be used to catch up with longer-range Brawlers if they get hit by Shelly's Super.","Shelly can slow down the entire enemy team with her Shell Shock Star Power, making way for a potential team wipe with the help of allies.","In Duo Showdown, two useful team compositions are Shelly and Tara, and Shelly and Gene, as either of them can pull enemies into Shelly, who can finish them off with her Super.","In Duo Showdown, if you have a teammate with ranged jumps like El Primo or Edgar, you can charge your Super up and then get defeated on purpose. When you are just about to respawn, your teammate can jump near an enemy team so that you respawn next to them. Then, use your Super to eliminate them rapidly, chaining Supers if needed. Your immunity shield will protect you while you do this. If your teammate is a squishier Brawler like Crow, they may jump slightly further away from the enemy and you can then use your Fast Forward Gadget to get near the enemies and use the same strategy. This will result in a team-wipe as it works well regardless of the number of Power Cubes the enemy has, since the immunity shield you get after respawning for a couple seconds makes you impossible to defeat for some seconds: enough time to finish the team off. Be wary of Brawlers like Bull or Darryl, though, as they can charge and roll away respectively from you before you respawn.","Shelly is moderately good in Brawl Ball since she can destroy the walls blocking the enemy's goal and allow your team to score more easily. A rather useful tactic some people use is shooting the ball and then immediately using her Super to break any obstacles in the way and pushing back enemies in front of the goal, which could potentially lead to a victory in said game mode."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Shelly","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/shelly/skins/Shelly/Default.png"},{"name":"Star","cost":"Free for registering before 2019","campaign":"Brawl Stars Pioneer","path":"/brawlers/shelly/skins/Shelly/Star.png"},{"name":"Classic","cost":"Free from Brawlidays 2022 gift","campaign":"2022 Anniversary","path":"/brawlers/shelly/skins/Shelly/Classic.png"},{"name":"Bandita","cost":"Free from Daily Gift Streak, 29 Gems or 1000 Bling","campaign":"Outlaws","path":"/brawlers/shelly/skins/Shelly/Bandita.png"},{"name":"Boca Juniors","cost":"49 Gems","campaign":"Latin America Master League","path":"/brawlers/shelly/skins/Shelly/Boca%20Juniors.png"},{"name":"America","cost":"49 Gems","campaign":"Latin America Master League","path":"/brawlers/shelly/skins/Shelly/America.png"},{"name":"U De Chile","cost":"49 Gems","campaign":"Latin America Master League","path":"/brawlers/shelly/skins/Shelly/U%20De%20Chile.png"},{"name":"PSG","cost":"Free from the PSG Cup of 2020, 79 Gems or 2750 Bling","campaign":"PSG","path":"/brawlers/shelly/skins/Shelly/PSG.png"},{"name":"Witch","cost":"149 Gems","campaign":"Brawl-o-ween","path":"/brawlers/shelly/skins/Shelly/Witch.png"},{"name":"Hoot Hoot","cost":"199 Gems","campaign":"Brawl-o-ween","path":"/brawlers/shelly/skins/Shelly/Hoot%20Hoot.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/shelly/skins/Shelly/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/shelly/skins/Shelly/True%20Gold.png"},{"name":"Princess","cost":"Brawl Pass Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/shelly/skins/Shelly/Princess.png"},{"name":"Shelly Dancer","cost":"Brawl Pass Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/shelly/skins/Shelly/Shelly%20Dancer.png"},{"name":"Shelly Dancer Iris","cost":"Brawl Pass Plus Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/shelly/skins/Shelly/Shelly%20Dancer%20Iris.png"},{"name":"Shelly Dancer Dahlia","cost":"Brawl Pass Plus Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/shelly/skins/Shelly/Shelly%20Dancer%20Dahlia.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/shelly/skins/Shelly/"}],"hypercharge":[{"name":"Double Barrel","description":"Super Shell is 33% larger.","path":"/hypercharges/Double%20Barrel.png"}],"healthByLevel":[3700,4070,4440,4810,5180,5550,5920,6290,6660,7030,7400],"attack":{"name":"Buckshot","description":"Shelly's boomstick fires a wide spread of pellets to a medium range.
