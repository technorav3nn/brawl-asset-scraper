This can be ignored in Solo Showdown or Lone Star after you get your first boost; instead, use his Super for area denial or a knockback. In both Solo and Team events, getting your Super quickly is essential.","Ruffs' attacks can be utilized like Rico's attacks since they bounce off walls, and his attack shoots two projectiles, so he can hit enemies without coming under fire himself due to his relatively low health. This can be handy when playing in maps with many walls, such as Cavern Churn. In order maximize your chances of hitting the enemy with both of your shots, utilize manual aim wherever possible. If you aim correctly, Ruffs can offer a lot of offensive power. His Double-Barrel Laser can deal moderate damage as well as his Super. The offensive power of Ruffs increases if he is buffed by a power-up or using his Air Superiority Star Power.","If you are in danger, use the Take Cover Gadget, as he is able to protect himself (and allies) while being able to shoot over the sandbags. The sandbags won’t protect against piercing attacks or bouncing attacks though (even less so against Penny, Surge, Belle, or Jessie) so be cautious when a Brawler with such attacks comes at you.","In any mode with teammates, make sure each of your allies receive a power-up from Ruffs' Super, allowing you and your team to have an advantage. The immediate heal from a power-up offers some protection to low-health Brawlers. If the teammate in question is not behind cover, saving a power-up for more vital situations is more effective. If you have a Super ready and everyone on the team is buffed by it (they've all picked up a power-up each), you may also throw the Super near your team's respawn point, so that should someone get defeated, they can immediately pick up a power-up and get back into action.","His Field Promotion Star Power is very good in Duo Showdown. Standing near high-health Brawlers like Frank and El Primo can drastically increase their health, which will help in later game. However, the boosted health is circumvented by Colette due to her increasing damage with more health. It can also be used in Bounty to help lower-health Brawlers like Tick to survive at least one more attack.","Ruffs' Air Superiority Star Power allows his Super to break obstacles and defeat enemies quicker, and even without the Star Power, Ruffs' Super can be used over walls to attack enemies behind cover, in which his Super be very useful while playing Brawl Ball. You’ll want to use Air Superiority rather than Field Promotion in Brawl Ball unless you don't have the former because you won't often be near your teammates in this event (due to the dangers of team-wiping) and the slow action of this Star Power won’t be quick enough in a fast-moving event like Brawl Ball, unlike in slower-moving events like Bounty and Duo Showdown. Also, you cannot miss the advantages of Air Superiority (to break walls and team-wipe the opposition) for the other 's rather ineffective power. It’s also vital to note that after scoring a goal, power-ups are lost so power-ups may not be very useful, but his Air Superiority Star Power is still beneficial as it can knock enemies from the ball and destroy cover (especially goal barriers), so you need to strategically aim your Super to give extra benefit.","An interesting use of Ruff's Field Promotion Star Power in Heist is to camp near your spawn area with both teammates for about 1 minute. If the enemy team tries to attack, the offensive power of your teammates will easily defend the safe. Moreover, camping for 1 minute will give an advantage of 1800+ health. Paired with the 700 health and damage buff from Ruff's power-up, it can increase the health of low-health Brawlers like Tick and Crow to around 6000 health, making them even more difficult to counter.","Ruffs' Air Support can be used to force enemies into or out of a choke point where they can easily be defeated or it helps your team otherwise. It can also be used as extra damage on Siege Bots and the enemy IKE in Siege, and the safe in Heist."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Ruffs","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/ruffs/skins/Ruffs/Default.png"},{"name":"Marshal","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","campaign":"Outlaws","path":"/brawlers/ruffs/skins/Ruffs/Marshal.png"},{"name":"Ruffs Chimmy","cost":"149 Gems","campaign":"BT21","path":"/brawlers/ruffs/skins/Ruffs/Ruffs%20Chimmy.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/ruffs/skins/Ruffs/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/ruffs/skins/Ruffs/True%20Gold.png"},{"name":"Ronin","cost":"Brawl Pass Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/ruffs/skins/Ruffs/Ronin.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/ruffs/skins/Ruffs/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[2800,3080,3360,3640,3920,4200,4480,4760,5040,5320,5600],"attack":{"name":"Space Laser","description":"Ruffs' twin-laser bounces off walls multiple times.
