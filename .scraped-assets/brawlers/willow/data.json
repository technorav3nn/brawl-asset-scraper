Willow also an advantage over Crow in that she can lob her projectiles to check bushes behind the safety of walls.","Willow's Super can be used to undo another Willow's Super, shooting the Super at a teammate who is under the hex of another Willow.","Although enemy Brawlers are forced out of Willow's Super when they fall below 30% HP, it is possible for a controlled enemy to be completely defeated if the opponent's teammate manages to deal enough damage at once.","This strategy is most effective against squishier Brawlers such as Tick or Spike, as their smaller health pool allows them to be defeated much more consistently."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Willow","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/willow/skins/Willow/Default.png"},{"name":"Axl","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/willow/skins/Willow/Axl.png"},{"name":"Scorpion","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","campaign":"Wasteland","path":"/brawlers/willow/skins/Willow/Scorpion.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/willow/skins/Willow/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[2800,3080,3360,3640,3920,4200,4480,4760,5040,5320,5600],"attack":{"name":"Lantern's Curse","description":"Willow lobs her lantern, dealing damage over time to enemies hit.","stats":{"attackrange":"7.33 (Long)","reload":"2 seconds (Slow)","attacksupercharge":"8.5%, 25.5% (with Spellbound)","attackspeed":"1750"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage per second","list":[400,440,480,520,560,600,640,680,720,760,800]}]},"super":{"name":"Hex","description":"Willow fires a single tadpole towards an enemy Brawler, fully healing them and taking control over their mind if it hits.
