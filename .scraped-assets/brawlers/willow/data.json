Willow also an advantage over Crow in that she can lob her projectiles to check bushes behind the safety of walls.","Willow's Super can be used to undo another Willow's Super, shooting the Super at a teammate who is under the hex of another Willow."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"28/03/23:","description":"Willow became available to play in the Training Cave.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"30/03/23:","description":"Willow's main attack damage now takes effect instantly (from after 1 second).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"30/03/23:","description":"The number of hits necessary to charge Willow's Super was decreased to 12 hits (from 15).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"30/03/23:","description":"Fixed some issues related to Willow's Super.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"03/04/23:","description":"Willow and her Axl skin were added to the game.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"03/04/23:","description":"Fixed an issue with Willow's visual and sound effects.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"03/04/23:","description":"Fixed an issue where Willow's main attacks couldn't break skulls.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"03/04/23:","description":"Fixed an issue where Willow's Super would crash the game.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"25/04/23:","description":"Willow's Obsession Star Power speed boost was decreased to 25% (from 75%).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"28/04/23:","description":"Willow's Dive Gadget and Obsession Star Power were added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"06/06/23:","description":"Willow's Super range was increased to 8.33 tiles (from 7.67).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"06/06/23:","description":"Willow's Super now grants her a 25% damage-reduction shield while controlling an enemy.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"06/06/23:","description":"Enemies no longer charge their Super from attacks while controlled.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"06/06/23:","description":"Fixed an issue with Willow's mind-control in Brawl Ball.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"05/09/23:","description":"Willow's health was increased to 2800 (from 2500).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"05/09/23:","description":"All Brawlers' health and damage were increased from 5% to 10% with each Power Level.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"11/09/23:","description":"The Scorpion Willow skin was added.
