His Super can control a large area and can easily allow you and allies to deal large amounts of damage to enemies. If your Super is taken down, focus on charging up a second Super and pushing back enemies.","Other than his very slow movement speed, 8-Bit has all that one would require from a Brawler - high health and a high damage output, long range, a reasonable reload speed, area control, and even some support abilities, so he functions well in most game modes. However, he is most viable in Heist, Gem Grab, Hot Zone, and Siege due to his high damage output and area control capabilities. In Bounty, Showdown, Knockout, Special Events, and speed-based events such as Brawl Ball, his slow movement speed hinders his survivability, but his high health, long range, and high damage output compensates for that, making him still viable in these modes.","8-Bit’s is very vulnerable to fast Brawlers such as Crow and Leon. At the start of Showdown matches, focus first in defeating these Brawlers at a distance before they get closer and can deal higher damage. 8-Bit has one of the longest ranges in the game to compensate for his slow movement, so keep your distance from enemy Brawlers and out-range them, and if an enemy is chasing you, deal as much damage as you can to them from a distance to force enemy retreat. Additionally, you can also escape by using your Cheat Cartridge Gadget to teleport back to your booster and far away from enemies. However, be cautious of airborne Brawlers like El Primo and Edgar who are also fast and can close the distance with their jumps and easily defeat 8-Bit at close range.","If you are low on health and someone is chasing you, you can place your booster down to tank some shots so you can escape more easily. Keep in mind, this won’t be effective against Penny, Jessie, Surge, Belle, or any other Brawler with mechanics that can deal damage to multiple enemies, as their projectiles won’t be fully blocked. Also, note that this should be a last-resort action, as he depends on his booster quite a lot.","Due to 8-Bit's slow movement speed, dodging projectiles from other sharpshooters like Colt or throwers like Barley is difficult. So dealing damage behind cover or from afar is recommended as the enemies won’t be able to hit him as easily. This can be compensated with his Plugged In Star Power or other speed boosts, as 8-Bit can fight the fast and long-ranged Brawlers with ease that he’s usually prone to in Showdown. It can also be very useful to control, retreat, and reach a target in most 3v3 modes and special events. Though, Boosted Booster is preferred in Robo Rumble, Boss Fight, and Super City Rampage, where speed is less beneficial.","8-Bit's Cheat Cartridge Gadget can be used to rush and surprise an enemy by throwing his booster over the wall towards the enemy before teleporting to attack them with increased damage, since he normally can’t rush an enemy due to his very slow movement speed. It can also be used to escape enemies by teleporting away if you're low on health or if you’re being cornered.","8-Bit's Extra Credits Gadget combined with his Super would deal enough damage to eliminate almost all Brawlers in-game without losing ammo, but it can be easily avoided. Use it on modes with stationary targets like Heist and Siege, with it dealing devastating damage to these above examples. You may also use it in Special Events to deal extra damage to the Bosses in each event, but note that mobility is very important in Super City Rampage and might justify the usage of Cheat Cartridge.","Byron can use his healing abilities to further justify 8-Bit's already high health at a range, and 8-Bit's Super can boost Byron's healing, so they have a great synergy together. This can also lead to devastating results in Siege if 8-Bit and Byron can remain concealed up to the corners closest to the enemy IKE. 8-Bit must place his booster down to boost his damage and Byron’s healing, and Byron heals 8-Bit while 8-Bit deals damage to the IKE, especially with his Extra Credits Gadget. High-damaging Brawlers like Amber, Spike, and Colt also work well with 8-Bit and help him get the most out of the booster.","It is typically a good idea to place your booster behind a wall (unless attacking where you can tank damage with the booster) because it’ll be harder to destroy and if someone gets there, you can use Cheat Cartridge to eliminate them. This is even more effective with Boosted Booster as it can provide more area of damage boost when keeping the booster behind a wall makes it hard to stay near it. However, this strategy is countered by throwers and Squeak as they can hit the booster regardless of any walls in their way.","When on low health and hiding in a bush, try not to place your Super when the Plugged In Star Power is equipped as the speed boost effect indicator coming from the Super can give away your location. However, if your plan is to escape rather than hide, you may place your Super to tank shots and speed you up.","In Super City Rampage, 8-Bit's damage booster can be used as a last-resort meatshield to escape from the monster during the anger stages as the monster will attack any turrets and spawnables such as Jessie's turret and Nita's Bear. Unless the monster is distracted, 8-Bit can’t escape because of his very slow movement speed.","An effective trap you can use, especially in Showdown, is to place your booster so that one side is behind a wall and a bush and the other is out in the open. When an enemy Brawler comes to destroy your booster, you can use your Cheat Cartridge Gadget to rush in and quickly eliminate the enemy, and if the enemy manages to destroy it, the damage dealt would’ve charged your Super back again, so you can pull off the trap again. If it’s a Brawler with moving abilities (Edgar, El Primo, Crow, etc.), use your long range to your advantage and aim your attack onto them if they do escape with their ability. This ensures them on low health or even defeats them."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"8-Bit","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/8-bit/skins/8-Bit/Default.png"},{"name":"8-Bit Classic","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/8-bit/skins/8-Bit/8-Bit%20Classic.png"},{"name":"V8-Bit","cost":"Free from the Retropolis Challenge or 79 Gems","campaign":"Retropolis Nights","path":"/brawlers/8-bit/skins/8-Bit/V8-Bit.png"},{"name":"Saloon","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Power League","path":"/brawlers/8-bit/skins/8-Bit/Saloon.png"},{"name":"Haunted House","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Enchanted Woods","path":"/brawlers/8-bit/skins/8-Bit/Haunted%20House.png"},{"name":"Virus","cost":"299 Gems","campaign":"Lunar Brawl","path":"/brawlers/8-bit/skins/8-Bit/Virus.png"},{"name":"Antivirus","cost":"299 Gems","campaign":"Lunar Brawl","path":"/brawlers/8-bit/skins/8-Bit/Antivirus.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/8-bit/skins/8-Bit/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/8-bit/skins/8-Bit/True%20Gold.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/8-bit/skins/8-Bit/"},{"name":"Damage Booster","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/8-bit/skins/Damage%20Booster/Default.png"},{"name":"8-Bit Classic","path":"/brawlers/8-bit/skins/Damage%20Booster/8-Bit%20Classic.png"},{"name":"V8-Bit","campaign":"Retropolis Nights","path":"/brawlers/8-bit/skins/Damage%20Booster/V8-Bit.png"},{"name":"Saloon","campaign":"Power League","path":"/brawlers/8-bit/skins/Damage%20Booster/Saloon.png"},{"name":"Haunted House","campaign":"Enchanted Woods","path":"/brawlers/8-bit/skins/Damage%20Booster/Haunted%20House.png"},{"name":"Virus","campaign":"Lunar Brawl","path":"/brawlers/8-bit/skins/Damage%20Booster/Virus.png"},{"name":"Antivirus","campaign":"Lunar Brawl","path":"/brawlers/8-bit/skins/Damage%20Booster/Antivirus.png"},{"name":"True Silver","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/8-bit/skins/Damage%20Booster/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/8-bit/skins/Damage%20Booster/True%20Gold.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/8-bit/skins/Damage Booster/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[5000,5500,6000,6500,7000,7500,8000,8500,9000,9500,10000],"attack":{"name":"Blaster Beams","description":"Shoots a burst of Blaster Beams that damage any opponent they hit.
