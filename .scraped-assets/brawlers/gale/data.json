Some of the modes he excels at most are control-based events like Hot Zone, Brawl Ball, Gem Grab, and Siege where pushing back enemies helps his team gain control of important areas such as the zones, the goalposts, the Gem mine, and the Bolts in each respective game mode. This is amplified if you have his Twister Gadget, which allows him to completely deny access to certain parts of the map like mentioned above for 5 seconds.","A maximum of 4 snowballs hit targets with normal-sized hitboxes like Brawlers and the Heist safe at a relatively close range unless the target moves considerably, as the snowballs don’t originate from the center of the attack.","Gale's Super allows him to displace enemies into his favor, depending on the situation. He can either push them away from him and his team to save him and them (especially from close-ranged attacks) or push the enemy team into his, allowing for allied close-ranged Brawlers to deal more damage.","Be careful when facing Emz or Piper as they deal more damage the further away their target is. In some situations, using Gale’s Super on them inadvertently allows them to deal massive damage to you, so it’s better to push them when behind walls, into walls with his Blustery Blow Star Power, or into other enemies or into the poison clouds in Showdown. However, if Gale is near them, he should quickly eliminate them and ignore a charged Super, because both the Brawlers deal mediocre damage at close range and won't be a match for Gale.","Gale's support abilities truly shine in events like Gem Grab and Bounty where he should use his Super to protect the Gem or Star carrier from approaching enemy tanks and other high-damaging enemies by pushing them back a considerable distance. He may also push enemies away from the Gem mine, allow for control of it and collecting Gems at ease.","Gale is also useful for Heist and Siege. One of the best ways to use Gale's Spring Ejector Gadget in these events is to position the launch pad in such a way that when Gale and fellow Brawlers use it, they are able to reach the other team's safe or IKE. Make sure to change the position of the launch pad every so often in order to make it more unpredictable as to where allies will land. In addition, if Gale is the protector of his and team’s safe or IKE, he can push enemies away from his and his team’s safe or IKE in a direction that the enemies will be far from their safe or IKE as well, buying more time for his teammates to defeat the enemies’ safe or IKE; He can also push enemies away from the Bolts, or slow them down from receiving Bolts with the Freezing Snow Star Power.","Gale can be a great asset to any Brawl Ball/Basket Brawl/Trophy Thieves team, as his Spring Ejector Gadget can help get his teammates back into action by placing it at the foot of his goal or trophy area, and his Super can knock the Ball or trophy out of a carrier's grasp, while blowing them away from the ball or trophy. Gale's Super also affects the landing position of the respective item if it’s being carried which allows him to potentially score goals within 3 tiles away from the enemy goal or shoot the trophy into the trophy area.","Gale is an outstanding control Brawler for Hot Zone. His Super pushes enemy Brawlers back, giving time for teammates to heal up and for allies to deal damage. This allows for more capturing of the zones while the enemies have to make their way back. This is most useful in maps where there is a single hot zone in the center (i.e. Dueling Beetles and Ring of Fire). Gale’s Spring Ejector Gadget is also a valuable help, as the launch pad can allow allies to reach zones quicker and providing a solid defense in the zone.","Gale is not a bad choice in Boss Fight and Super City Rampage since the Boss's and the Monster's hitboxes are larger than normal, so all 6 snowballs from Gale's attack will hit, dealing more damage than usual. At maximum level, his snowballs can deal up to 2352 damage, and he can deal damage consistently. His Super is also useful to cancel out the Boss's or Monster's special attacks, especially with his Blustery Blow Star Power so you can stun them, or to distance yourself from them when they are using their melee attacks on you or chasing you when both teammates are dead. You can also use his Freezing Snow Star Power on the Mega Monster to buy time to defeat it.","A combination of Gale's Super with his Blustery Blow Star Power and three main attacks (assuming that four projectiles hit per attack) can guarantee defeat to an enemy with 5040 or less health.","Gale is a decent choice in Big Game because as the Big Boss, he can push enemies away from him, and with his Blustery Blow Star Power, he can stun the Hunters, though Blustery Blow is only effective when he is the Big Boss, as stuns are ineffective against the Big Boss. As a Hunter, he can place his Spring Ejector Gadget to allow close-ranged Hunters to circumvent obstacles or allow other Hunters to get back into action faster after being defeated, and he can slow the Big Boss with his Freezing Snow Star Power. Since the Big Boss has an extremely large hitbox, all of the snowballs will hit, dealing massive damage. If long-ranged Brawlers are on his team, he can push the Big Boss far, allowing them to deal massive damage.","When vulnerable enemies are hiding behind a one or two tile thick wall, Gale can use his Super to push them away from them the wall and then defeat them.","Gale with his Freezing Snow Star Power can limit enemy's strafing abilities and also force groups of Brawlers to group up to defeat Gale together by slowing them down, thus allowing splash-damage teammates or allies with piercing mechanics to easily perform a team-wipe.","Note that Gale's Twister Gadget only hinders enemy movement, not enemy attacks, so stay an ample distance away from it to avoid heavy, long-ranged fire. Gale's Twister Gadget can also make enemy Brawlers go over walls."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"13/05/20:","description":"Gale and his Merchant skin were added to the game.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"03/06/20:","description":"Gale's Second Wind Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"02/07/20:","description":"Gale no longer knocks himself back upon activating Super, and his Super enemy knockback distance was increased.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"02/07/20:","description":"Gale's main attack width was decreased to 2 tiles (from 3).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"02/07/20:","description":"Gale's main attack damage was decreased to 320 (from 360) per snowball.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"02/07/20:","description":"Gale's main attack now fires 6 smaller projectiles (from 5) for improved damage dealing consistency.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"18/08/20:","description":"Gale's main attack damage was decreased to 280 (from 320) per snowball.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"18/08/20:","description":"The number of hits necessary to charge his Super was increased to 12 hits (from 10).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"09/10/20:","description":"Gale's Spring Ejector Gadget range was decreased to 6 tiles (from 12) and given an altered look.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"09/10/20:","description":"Gale's second Star Power was renamed to Freezing Snow (from Second Wind) and reworked from giving teammates hit by his Super a 20% speed boost for 2 seconds to slowing down enemies hit by his attack for 0.3 seconds.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"22/10/20:","description":"Gale's reload time was decreased to 1.2 seconds (from 1.4).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"15/12/20:","description":"Gale's health was increased to 3600 (from 3400).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"23/12/20:","description":"The Nutcracker Gale skin was added.
