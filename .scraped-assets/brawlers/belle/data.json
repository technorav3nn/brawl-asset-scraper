Belle can also use her Nest Egg Gadget to keep enemies close enough for her attack to bounce more.","The boosted damage on enemies hit by Belle's Super makes her an ideal counter to tanks. The damage boost allows her teammates and her to deal enough damage to eliminate tanks. This also works to get rid of Brawlers with a very high amount of Power Cubes in Showdown, who can prove challenging to defeat in the later stages of the game where she is limited by poison clouds to maintain her distance from enemies. However, you must maintain your distance from tanks as much as you can due to their superior health and close-ranged damage.","Her Positive Feedback Star Power's duration doesn’t stack, so conserving shots is better to prolong the shield. The 20% shield gives her health equivalent to Colette, and since she doesn't have a guaranteed way to push away rushing Brawlers, conserving shots to prolong the shield gives you a better chance of surviving.","The shield Belle gets from her Positive Feedback Star Power and the extra damage she can deal with her Super makes her very good for 1v1 interactions as her survivability is increased while the enemy's health is decreased.","Belle's low health means that getting close to enemies is not a viable option, similar to Piper. However, unlike Piper, who has her Super to escape from close-ranged Brawlers if it’s charged up, Belle doesn't have much to defend herself at close range, so she’s vulnerable to heavyweights or assassins. If you're running away from such a Brawler, you can lay your Nest Egg Gadget behind you to deter them from reaching you as disarming the Gadget is not possible without getting slowed. Additionally, if you have her Super charged, you can fire her Super onto the enemy so they receive more damage, and with her Grounded Star Power, momentarily disarms them. If you don’t have her Nest Egg Gadget or your Super charged up, try to predict where the heavyweight or assassin will go, and stay mobile to ensure they can’t reach you.","Her Nest Egg Gadget is great to trap choke-points on maps such as Cavern Churn, Gem Fort, or Acid Lakes as it can force Brawlers to walk over her traps, giving the opportunity for a good ambush. Belle's Nest Egg Gadget can also be used for maximum effect in Hot Zone, where it can be used to maintain zone control by trapping it and make enemies vulnerable to being slowed and being eliminated by allies. Enemies that aren’t tanks or assassins or don’t have moving abilities can’t travel around it and will have to step on them, guaranteeing ambushes.","Belle has one of the longest consistent ranges in the game. You can use this to your advantage to keep your distance and poke at Brawlers. Because of the bouncing, enemies are forced to separate and you and/or your team can trap and defeat them individually, leading the enemies into an uncomfortable situation and position. Her passive chaining bolts and their bounces force enemies to distance themselves, making them vulnerable to assassins who can pick them off individually. This allows her to combo well with assassin Brawlers like Edgar.","Belle is a good Brawler on the Showdown maps with the Angry Robo Modifier. She can attack the robot if its following a Brawler and the attack will keep bouncing between the robot and the Brawler for a sufficient amount of time, thus causing the Brawler to have less health or even get defeated. It’s less effective against Brawlers with moving abilities like Carl, Edgar, or Darryl who can escape."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Belle","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/belle/skins/Belle/Default.png"},{"name":"Ivy","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","campaign":"Biodome","path":"/brawlers/belle/skins/Belle/Ivy.png"},{"name":"Coral","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Deep Sea League","path":"/brawlers/belle/skins/Belle/Coral.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/belle/skins/Belle/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/belle/skins/Belle/True%20Gold.png"},{"name":"Belle Goldhand","cost":"Brawl Pass Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/belle/skins/Belle/Belle%20Goldhand.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/belle/skins/Belle/"}],"hypercharge":[{"name":"Magnetic","description":"Belle's spotting shot automatically follows the closest target.","path":"/hypercharges/Magnetic.png"}],"healthByLevel":[2600,2860,3120,3380,3640,3900,4160,4420,4680,4940,5200],"attack":{"name":"Shocker","description":"Belle shoots a long range Electro-Bolt, dealing damage to any target hit.
