Her Trait perfectly counters this as short-ranged Brawlers like Edgar and Mortis cannot reach her in a sufficiently large lake.","Eve's Unnatural Order Star Power allows Eve to fire the biggest egg first. This allows her to deal more immediate damage. This also allows Eve to have slightly more range.","Because of Eve's slow unload and reload speed, she can struggle in 1v1 situations with Brawlers with a high damage burst potential like Fang and Edgar, so you should play her passively from a long range, poking in and out of cover similarly to Mr. P.","Eve's Gotta Go! Gadget should be used to escape over walls and put distance between you and your enemies, similarly to Brock's Rocket Laces Gadget.","On maps with a lot of lakes like Island Invasion, Flowing Springs or Sapphire Plains, Eve can travel across the lakes to reach enemies faster and prevent taking much damage.","Because Eve's Super takes five seconds to crack open, you may think it's a good idea to place it in the map's backline. However, the hatchlings' health decreases over time, so try to use it decently far, but not too far from enemies.","Eve's Happy Surprise Star Power can be good against single target brawlers like Piper, Byron, Bea, Fang, and Bonnie while in her cannon form, as they have no way to effectively deal with a hatchling invasion."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Eve","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/eve/skins/Eve/Default.png"},{"name":"Baiku","cost":"149 Gems","campaign":"Lunar Brawl","path":"/brawlers/eve/skins/Eve/Baiku.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/eve/skins/Eve/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/eve/skins/Eve/True%20Gold.png"},{"name":"Spiky","cost":"Brawl Pass, 149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/eve/skins/Eve/Spiky.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/eve/skins/Eve/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[2900,3190,3480,3770,4060,4350,4640,4930,5220,5510,5800],"attack":{"name":"Egg Shooter","description":"Eve shoots three eggs in a row, with each one being bigger and dealing more damage than the previous egg.","stats":{"attackrange":"9.33 (Very Long)","reload":"1.6 seconds (Normal), 1.36 seconds (with Reload Gear)","attackbullets":"3","attacksupercharge":"12%","attackspeed":"3500","attackwidth":"0.67 (small egg), 1 (medium egg), 1.33 (large egg)"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Small Egg","list":[400,440,480,520,560,600,640,680,720,760,800]},{"name":"Medium Egg","list":[520,572,624,676,728,780,832,884,936,988,1040]},{"name":"Large Egg","list":[640,704,768,832,896,960,1024,1088,1152,1216,1280]}]},"super":{"name":"Baby Boom","description":"Eve releases a big egg, which incubates a group of hatchlings.
