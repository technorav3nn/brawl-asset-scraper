Her Trait perfectly counters this as short-ranged Brawlers like Edgar and Mortis cannot reach her in a sufficiently large lake.","Eve's Unnatural Order Star Power allows Eve to fire the biggest egg first. This allows her to deal more immediate damage. This also allows Eve to have slightly more range.","Because of Eve's slow unload and reload speed, she can struggle in 1v1 situations with Brawlers with a high damage burst potential like Fang and Edgar, so you should play her passively from a long range, poking in and out of cover similarly to Mr. P.","Eve's Gotta Go! Gadget should be used to escape over walls and put distance between you and your enemies, similarly to Brock's Rocket Laces Gadget.","On maps with a lot of lakes like Island Invasion, Flowing Springs or Sapphire Plains, Eve can travel across the lakes to reach enemies faster and prevent taking much damage.","Because Eve's Super takes five seconds to crack open, you may think it's a good idea to place it in the map's backline. However, the hatchlings' health decreases over time, so try to use it decently far, but not too far from enemies.","Eve's Happy Surprise Star Power can be good against single target brawlers like Piper, Byron, Bea, Fang, and Bonnie while in her cannon form, as they have no way to effectively deal with a hatchling invasion."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"05/03/22:","description":"Eve became available to play in the Training Cave.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"07/03/22:","description":"Eve and her Spiky skin were added to the game.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"31/03/22:","description":"Eve's main attack range was decreased to 9.33 tiles (from 10).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"06/04/22:","description":"Eve's Happy Surprise Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"20/04/22:","description":"Eve's Motherly Love Gadget was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"27/04/22:","description":"Eve's health was decreased to 2900 (from 3000).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"27/04/22:","description":"Eve's main attack damage was decreased to 370, 481, 592 (from 400, 520, 640).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"27/04/22:","description":"Eve's main attack projectile speed was decreased by 5%.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"29/06/22:","description":"The number of hits necessary to charge Eve's Super was increased to 9 hits (from 7).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"29/06/22:","description":"Eve's Happy Surprise Star Power now takes 5 seconds to charge.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"29/06/22:","description":"Eve's True Silver and True Gold skins were added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"25/10/22:","description":"Eve's main attack damage was increased to 400, 520, 640 (from 370, 481, 592).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"17/01/23:","description":"The Baiku Eve skin was added.
