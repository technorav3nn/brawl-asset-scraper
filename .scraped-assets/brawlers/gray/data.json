This can be prevented by manually aiming his Super away from close range Brawlers.","In Solo Showdown, you should save your super as a last resort when you need to escape from a tight situation. The Super activation is instant and unlike the regular teleport, enemies can't use the dimensional door.","His attack reload is slow and his bullets are delayed so its best to aim your attacks rather than auto aiming.","In Heist, Gray can put his Super near the enemies' safe, so that teammates can quickly teleport to the safe to do damage and/or quickly escape from defending enemies.","This can be devastating to the enemies' safe when used by teammates such as Buzz and Spike, as they can quickly melt the enemies' safe, and the enemies are pressured to defend both the teleporter and the safe.","By using his Walking Cane Gadget, Gray can finish off low health brawlers hiding behind walls, or can even disarm enemies holding the ball in Brawl Ball.","Teleporting while pulling an enemy with Gray's Walking Cane Gadget can allow the pull range to be extended to Gray's initial position before teleporting, allowing the player to bring high-focus targets like a Gem carrier closer to your team.","While camping near Gray's teleporters is a viable strategy to ambush him or his teammates, do note that if you stand too close to one they will begin to glow similarly to when they are being activated, betraying your location."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Gray","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/gray/skins/Gray/Default.png"},{"name":"Runaway","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/gray/skins/Gray/Runaway.png"},{"name":"Detective (Noir Edition)","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling, available after purchasing Detective Gray","campaign":"License to Brawl","path":"/brawlers/gray/skins/Gray/Detective%20(Noir%20Edition).png"},{"name":"Detective","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","campaign":"License to Brawl","path":"/brawlers/gray/skins/Gray/Detective.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/gray/skins/Gray/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/gray/skins/Gray/True%20Gold.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/gray/skins/Gray/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[3300,3630,3960,4290,4620,4950,5280,5610,5940,6270,6600],"attack":{"name":"Finger Pistol","description":"Are the bullets even real?","stats":{"attackrange":"9 (Long)","reload":"1.4 seconds (Fast)","attacksupercharge":"29%","attackspeed":"3804, 3200 (with Walking Cane; launched), 2000 (with Walking Cane; hooked)","attackwidth":"0.33, 1.33 (with Walking Cane)"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage","list":[1160,1276,1392,1508,1624,1740,1856,1972,2088,2204,2320]}]},"super":{"name":"Dimensional Doors","description":"Gray creates a set of doors for him and his teammates, useful for quick escapes and sneaky attacks!","stats":{"superrange":"6.67 (Normal)"},"statsByLevel":[]},"model":{"path":"/brawlers/gray/model.png"},"avatar":{"path":"/brawlers/gray/avatar.png"}}
