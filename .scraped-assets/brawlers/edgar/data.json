Because of that, it's better to focus on other targets, specifically weaker ones like throwers and sharpshooters.","His healing however, along with his Fisticuffs Star Power (if you have it equipped), greatly help him take on tanks. It's still best to take caution when fighting them since they can 2-shot or 3-shot Edgar's low health, so be sure to use your Super to avoid some attacks and land as much punches so as to out-heal the tanks' damage.","Edgar is an incredibly great ambusher and camper in offense-oriented modes like Showdown. Though he has low health, he heals each time he lands a successful punch, and his reload and unload speed are extremely fast. When playing Edgar, it's best to use him in enclosed maps such as Cavern Churn, in which these are what he dominates in. In Duo Showdown, he can be paired up with healers like Byron, similarly to with tanks and other assassins to increase the chances of victory.","Edgar is an outstanding choice in speed-based modes like Brawl Ball because of his very fast movement speed and great mobility. He can kick the ball/trophy ahead of him and then use his Super to jump to the ball/trophy and grab it again (self-passing), similarly to El Primo. After self-passing, he can then quickly shoot the ball/trophy into the designated area. Edgar is also aided by the speed boost that he gains after his Super. Keep in mind that Edgar has low health so be careful while performing this.","His speed boost after his Super can also be utilized well in Gem Grab or Siege as he can jump onto the Gem mine or into the Bolt spawns, which then he can steal Gems or Bolts and quickly retreat. He can also use this to escape more effectively when he's in danger.","However, his low health and lack of range diminish his viability in the above modes due to his inability to deal with long-ranged enemies with control abilities that are versatile in the above modes. With his Hardcore Gadget and a Shield Gear, Edgar can take more damage before having to retreat.","With his Let's Fly Gadget, Edgar can quickly charge his Super to make a quick getaway or to ambush a target. It can also be used to get a Super when Supers are most necessary such as at the beginning of a match.","Edgar is a niche asset in Heist due to his consistent and high burst damage, allowing him to rapidly damage the safe with his punches along with his Hard Landing Star Power.","Edgar has the shortest attack range in the game, so it's necessary to maintain close range with enemies. If you don't have your Super, you can utilize cover to steadily advance to enemies. If you do have your Super charged up, use it to jump directly onto (ambush) an enemy. It's also niche to bush-camp and wait for an enemy to head near the bush, and then quickly exit the bush and attack them.","If fighting against Frank, it's recommended to attack and use Edgar's speed to your advantage. Each time Frank attacks, there's a delay, where Edgar can move behind Frank and deal damage while taking none and healing. You may also use your Super to evade Frank's devastating Super, therefore wasting it. Attacking works better with his Fisticuffs Star Power because of the boosted healing.","Brawlers with slow unload speeds like Pam and 8-Bit can be defeated by Edgar at close-quarters combat despite their high health since Edgar can unload all his attacks much quicker than them and heal himself in the process. Due to their slow unload and Edgar's speed boost after his Super, Edgar can strafe away from the majority of the fire. However, note that if Edgar incorrectly strafes, he might take the attack's full damage, dealing immense damage to him if not defeating him. Because of this, it's necessary to analyze all of your options and the enemy's before committing a jump on them.","In Boss Fight, Edgar can utilize his mechanics (his sheer burst damage/healing and great mobility) to provide nearly-unparalleled offense/defense. In this mode, he's best used as the Power Cube carrier since it grants him more survivability along with his healing and amplifies his already high damage. His Fisticuffs Star Power is more effective in this mode since he can dive into swarms of bots and heal more effectively than he already would and overall survive longer whereas Hard Landing, even with the additional damage it dishes out, it's still insufficient against higher-health entities.","Aside from Power Cubes and Fisticuffs, additional buffs will also benefit Edgar; 8-Bit, Ruffs, Pam, and Max all amplify Edgar's effectiveness in Boss Fight.","Though he has low health and short range, Edgar is decent in Super City Rampage and his viability is amplified with his Fisticuffs Star Power. He can stall the Boss for a long while, dealing a plethora of damage to it while also healing in the process. Edgar pairs best with healers like Byron in this mode as they can boost his healing and allow him to bring the Boss to low health without dying, even allowing him to defeat it.","Edgar is not often recommended in Bounty since long-ranged Brawlers dominate the mode and his short range makes him disadvantageous. If playing him in Bounty, focus on pressuring enemies in the back of the map, and perform hit-and-run attacks using your Super. However, don't play him in open Bounty maps like Purple Paradise as he's more vulnerable to longer-ranged Brawlers.","Edgar vs. Edgar matchups are quite common in Showdown due to Edgar's viability in the game mode. Since Edgar can heal from punches and displace others with his Super, the outcome of an Edgar vs. Edgar fight is usually unpredictable. However, there are some tactics you can perform to typically guarantee yourself a victory (unless the opposing Edgar does the same or has an advantage that you don't).","The first tactic is to run away from the enemy while attacking to \"extend\" your attack's range. Due to Edgar's quick unload speed and reload speed, the enemy will be low on health, if not dead, before realizing their mistake. Conversely, when facing another Edgar performing this tactic, use your Super to jump ahead of the enemy (if the opposing Edgar doesn't have their Super) or retreat (allowing you to use the same strategy in case the enemy Edgar follows you).","The second tactic is to auto-aim your Super in the middle of the fight to avoid a few punches. In an Edgar vs Edgar matchup, every ammo counts and therefore avoiding a few punches gives you an advantage. If the Edgar uses this strategy against you, either use your Super to escape or perform the first tactic.","Edgar is vulnerable to Brawlers with high burst damage or knockback abilities like Surge, Shelly, or Brock because they can use those abilities to evade Edgar and/or easily defeat him. When facing these Brawlers, it's best to use his Hardcore Gadget to reduce their damage once they use their defensive ability on him so he can survive longer and won't be easily defeated.","When trying to fight high-damaging Brawlers like Shelly or Spike, wait for them to use some of or all of their ammo, and then jump on them. Since they have the disadvantage of little to no ammo, Edgar can attack them with ease without taking much damage. Even if he takes damage when the enemy reloads, his attack heals him and offsets the enemy's previous damage, allowing him to secure a defeat. His Hardcore Gadget allows him to survive longer if he takes more damage."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Edgar","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/edgar/skins/Edgar/Default.png"},{"name":"Blackbird","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/edgar/skins/Edgar/Blackbird.png"},{"name":"Mecha (Unit-00)","cost":"49 Gems, available after purchasing Mecha Edgar","campaign":"Mecha Squad","path":"/brawlers/edgar/skins/Edgar/Mecha%20(Unit-00).png"},{"name":"Mecha (Unit-01)","cost":"49 Gems, available after purchasing Mecha Edgar","campaign":"Mecha Squad","path":"/brawlers/edgar/skins/Edgar/Mecha%20(Unit-01).png"},{"name":"Quickdraw","cost":"79 Gems or 2750","campaign":"Outlaws","path":"/brawlers/edgar/skins/Edgar/Quickdraw.png"},{"name":"Orochi","cost":"149 Gems","campaign":"Lunar Brawl","path":"/brawlers/edgar/skins/Edgar/Orochi.png"},{"name":"Doctor","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Biodome","path":"/brawlers/edgar/skins/Edgar/Doctor.png"},{"name":"Edgar Tata","cost":"149 Gems","campaign":"BT21","path":"/brawlers/edgar/skins/Edgar/Edgar%20Tata.png"},{"name":"Mecha","cost":"299 Gems","campaign":"Mecha Squad","path":"/brawlers/edgar/skins/Edgar/Mecha.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/edgar/skins/Edgar/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/edgar/skins/Edgar/True%20Gold.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/edgar/skins/Edgar/"}],"hypercharge":[{"name":"Outburst","description":"After using Super gain charging speed and reload speed for few seconds.","path":"/hypercharges/Outburst.png"}],"healthByLevel":[3300,3630,3960,4290,4620,4950,5280,5610,5940,6270,6600],"attack":{"name":"Fight Club","description":"Hits enemies with quick punches from his scarf, healing himself for each landed punch.","stats":{"attackrange":"2 (Short)","reload":"0.7 seconds (Very Fast), 0.35 seconds (with Hypercharge)","attackbullets":"2","attacksupercharge":"8.37%, 9.207% (with Super Charge Gear), 16.74% (with Hypercharge), 17.577% (with Super Charge Gear and Hypercharge)","attackspeed":"3500","attackwidth":"2"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage per punch","list":[540,594,648,702,756,810,864,918,972,1026,1080]},{"name":"Heal per punch","list":[189,207.9,226.8,245.7,264.6,283.5,302.4,321.29999999999995,340.2,359.1,378]}]},"super":{"name":"Vault","description":"Edgar jumps over any obstacle and gets a temporary speed boost.
