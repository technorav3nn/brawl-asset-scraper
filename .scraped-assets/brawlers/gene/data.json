It is also extended if Gene uses a launch pad while firing his Super, or if he teleports.","While an enemy is being pulled by Gene, they are stunned and unable to do anything. It is therefore recommended to start shooting at them the moment you have grabbed them and not afterwards.","In Duo Showdown, Gene can be deadly when paired up with short-ranged, high-damaging Brawlers like Bull and Griff as pulling someone allows teammates finish them off easily. This is made more consistent because Gene can charge his Super again with four complete attacks.","Gene's Super interrupts enemy attacks and Supers, so he can halt Carl's Super and Frank from landing his Super, etc.","Gene's Super is an incredibly useful tool that can turn the tide of a game. It can target the highest-value target in modes such as Bounty and Gem Grab, dragging them into your team for an easy burst-down. It's also a great way to engage low-health enemies.","His Super can be used very effectively in Big Game to drag the Boss toward your group of allies so that they can deal extra damage, unless your team consists of low-health Brawlers with higher damage at long range such as Bea or Piper.","The effectiveness of Gene's Super can be amplified when used in Events with Modifiers active. It can be used to pull enemies into the area where meteors are going to land, pull them into robots, or pull them away from energy drinks and healing mushrooms. His Super can also be used to pull enemies into the poison gas.","In Siege, Gene can pull the Siege Robot away from the IKE with his Super. Alternatively, he can use his Lamp Blowout Gadget to instead push the Siege Robot away. These tactics can give his team more time to defeat the Siege Bot and prevent it from defeating the IKE. Gene can also pull enemies into the range of his team's turret to have the turret quickly defeat them (unless the turret is attacking another target, so it is advised to only do this when there isn't any Siege).","When using Gene's Super, be aware of who your target is. Avoid using it on close-medium ranged Brawlers or a Brawler with a dangerous Super charged, like Shelly or Carl (if he uses his Super after you pull him with yours), and in Showdown, an enemy with a large amount of Power Cubes; doing so in these situations will most likely result in backfire. If you do accidentally use your Super on the above Brawlers, make sure to use your Lamp Blowout Gadget to push them back, giving you ample time and distance to attack or escape from them.","Gene's pull has priority over every entity in the game except against another Gene that is pulling someone. This means Gene can pull enemies into minecarts in Minecart Madness to deal 2000 damage to them. Gene can also make use of his Gadget Lamp Blowout to push enemies into the minecarts.","Since Gene's attack has a very wide spread angle, it is very effective at checking bushes. His attack is also effective at dealing small chip damage that prevents enemies from healing from a long range, similar to Crow's poison.","Gene's Magic Puffs Star Power is useless in Solo events due to the lack of teammates, so always use his Spirit Slap Star Power in Solo events.","Spirit Slap can be used as a great finish to low-health enemies, as his Super deals damage when it hits them. However, do keep in mind that if Gene uses his Super on a gem carrier with less than 1000 health while using Spirit Slap, the gems will be dropped where the enemy gem carrier was, and it make grabbing the gems harder.","Gene is especially powerful when paired with Max, as Gene can heal Max with his Magic Puffs Star Power while she provides consistent damage, and Max's speed boost from her Super allows Gene to consistently land his Supers. This combination is also extremely deadly in 3v3 modes.","Gene's Super will guarantee to hit an enemy if auto-aimed at a relatively close range. Be aware that you may pull an unexpected target so make sure to aim it if you want to guarantee a hit on a certain enemy or if you are pulling at a long range."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Gene","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/gene/skins/Gene/Default.png"},{"name":"Pirate","cost":"79 Gems","campaign":"Tales of the Sea","path":"/brawlers/gene/skins/Gene/Pirate.png"},{"name":"Swamp","cost":"79 Gems","campaign":"Brawl-o-ween","path":"/brawlers/gene/skins/Gene/Swamp.png"},{"name":"Evil","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Sands of Time","path":"/brawlers/gene/skins/Gene/Evil.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/gene/skins/Gene/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/gene/skins/Gene/True%20Gold.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/gene/skins/Gene/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[3600,3960,4320,4680,5040,5400,5760,6120,6480,6840,7200],"attack":{"name":"Smoke Blast","description":"Gene shoots a solid ball of magical smoke from his lamp.
