Take advantage of bushes, obstacles, or thin choke points to ambush and defeat enemies.","Buster's wide and piercing attack makes it very effective against grouped-up enemies. Use this to your advantage to charge your Super faster.","When using his Super, make sure to point it in the direction of possible enemy attacks. Remember to strafe in the same direction as the enemy to deflect their attacks and avoid getting hit from the side.","Be mindful when using Buster's Super, as it can be interrupted (unless Buster has his Kevlar Vest Star Power equipped) and will cancel Buster's Super.","Buster's barrier only counterattacks when it is hit, so it is possible to hit him from the side. Attacks from above, such as Barley's main attack, will also not be reflected.","Use his Utility Belt Gadget in more supportive game modes like Gem Grab and Bounty. Buster's Slo-Mo Replay Gadget is handier in more aggressive modes like Brawl Ball, where he can disarm the ball carrier.","If you are facing a Bo, make sure you have the Kevlar Vest Star Power equipped. If you trigger a Bo's Super mine, then activate your Super. If you do so, then you will not be knocked back, and you will withstand more damage."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Buster","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/buster/skins/Buster/Default.png"},{"name":"Crocodile","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Rumble Jungle Heroes","path":"/brawlers/buster/skins/Buster/Crocodile.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/buster/skins/Buster/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/buster/skins/Buster/True%20Gold.png"},{"name":"Chainsaw","cost":"Brawl Pass, 149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/buster/skins/Buster/Chainsaw.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/buster/skins/Buster/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[5200,5720,6240,6760,7280,7800,8320,8840,9360,9880,10400],"attack":{"name":"Lens Flare","description":"Buster shoots a cone of light from his projector, damaging all enemies within range.","stats":{"attackrange":"5.33 (Normal)","reload":"1.8 seconds (Normal)","attacksupercharge":"36.5-18.25% (close to max range)","attackspread":"45°","attackspeed":"4200"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage at min. range","list":[1400,1540,1680,1820,1960,2100,2240,2380,2520,2660,2800]},{"name":"Damage at max range","list":[700,770,840,910,980,1050,1120,1190,1260,1330,1400]}]},"super":{"name":"Montage","description":"Buster projects a shield in front of him, blocking all enemy projectiles and reflecting the energy back towards enemies.","stats":{"superrange":"3 (Short)","superspread":"60°","superspeed":"3200","superduration":"3 seconds"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Counterattack damage","list":[800,880,960,1040,1120,1200,1280,1360,1440,1520,1600]}]},"model":{"path":"/brawlers/buster/model.png"},"avatar":{"path":"/brawlers/buster/avatar.png"}}
