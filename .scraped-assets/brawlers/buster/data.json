Take advantage of bushes, obstacles, or thin choke points to ambush and defeat enemies.","Buster's wide and piercing attack makes it very effective against grouped-up enemies. Use this to your advantage to charge your Super faster.","When using his Super, make sure to point it in the direction of possible enemy attacks. Remember to strafe in the same direction as the enemy to deflect their attacks and avoid getting hit from the side.","Be mindful when using Buster's Super, as it can be interrupted (unless Buster has his Kevlar Vest Star Power equipped) and will cancel Buster's Super.","Buster's barrier only counterattacks when it is hit, so it is possible to hit him from the side. Attacks from above, such as Barley's main attack, will also not be reflected.","Use his Utility Belt Gadget in more supportive game modes like Gem Grab and Bounty. Buster's Slo-Mo Replay Gadget is handier in more aggressive modes like Brawl Ball, where he can disarm the ball carrier.","If you are facing a Bo, make sure you have the Kevlar Vest Star Power equipped. If you trigger a Bo's Super mine, then activate your Super. If you do so, then you will not be knocked back, and you will withstand more damage."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"31/10/22:","description":"Buster became available to play in the Training Cave.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"07/11/22:","description":"Buster and his Chainsaw skin were added to the game.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"08/11/22:","description":"Fixed a bug that prevented players from using Wild Card Power Points on Buster.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"15/11/22:","description":"Buster's health was decreased to 5000 (from 5600).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"15/11/22:","description":"Buster's main attack damage was decreased to 1580 (from 1700) at close range.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"15/11/22:","description":"Buster's Super charge rate was decreased slightly.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"15/11/22:","description":"Buster's Utility Belt Gadget healing was decreased to 500 (from 1000) per ally.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"28/11/22:","description":"Buster's Slo-Mo Replay Gadget and Kevlar Vest Star Power were added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"12/12/22:","description":"Buster's health was decreased to 4800 (from 5000).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"12/12/22:","description":"Buster's main attack damage was decreased to 1480 (from 1580) at close range.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"12/12/22:","description":"Buster's facial animations were slightly reworked.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"12/01/23:","description":"Buster's main attack damage was decreased to 1320 (from 1480) at close range.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"12/01/23:","description":"The number of hits necessary to charge Buster's Super was increased to 4 hits (from 3) at close range.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"12/01/23:","description":"Buster's Super duration was decreased to 3 seconds (from 6).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"12/01/23:","description":"Buster's Kevlar Vest Star Power damage reduction was decreased to 10% (from 20%).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"28/02/23:","description":"Buster's True Silver and True Gold skins were added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"25/04/23:","description":"Chainsaw Buster's main attack and Super visual effects were reworked.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"09/05/23:","description":"The Crocodile Buster skin was added.
