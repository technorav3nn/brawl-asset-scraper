If he does it correctly, he can arrive in the Zone with an invincibility shield still active, allowing for guaranteed points in the Zone.","Chuck is great in Brawl Ball as, due to his insane mobility, he can dash towards the ball carrier and defeat them, or he can distract the opponent team or protect his allies while they try to score a goal.","Chuck can deal incredible damage to stationary targets with his Super, so he's great in Heist and Siege. Once he has his Posts spawned, he can use his fast-charging Super to repeatedly dash on to and back from the safe or the turret. This allows him to quickly deal damage and retreat with unbelievable speed. In Siege, he can place his posts to quickly dash onto the bolt's spawn point, or align the Post from his Super with the enemy's IKE turret, then use it to dash, dealing 3500 damage on the way. He will receive a 50% damage reduction shield while using his Super, which, combined with his fast-moving Super speed, allows him to repeatedly damage the IKE turret while taking minimal damage. He can also deal high damage to defending enemies if they align with the turret and your team's robot advancing, potentially taking them out.","Chuck can throw a Post over a wall, and then at any time he can activate his Ghost Train Gadget and use his Super to get through the wall and quickly eliminate anyone hiding behind the wall near his Post.","Chuck has a generally slow reload speed, so it is always best to be at or near full ammo when using his Super to dash, or hitting people with his Tickets Please! Star Power equipped.","Chuck can be predictable if activating his Super with the exact same Posts, allowing for enemies to camp out his final Post where he will stop. To avoid this, use his Rerouting Gadget to remove a Post, and place it somewhere else, possibly changing his final destination.","Chuck already has insane mobility without any assistance, but his Pit Stop Star Power can increase his mobility even more by allowing him to have up to 4 (from 3) Posts on the ground, allowing him to cover even more ground with his dashing Super."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"11/10/23:","description":"Chuck became available to play in the Training Cave.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"11/10/23:","description":"Chuck could be unlocked early as a bundle for $19.99.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"17/10/23:","description":"The Inferno Chuck skin was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"18/10/23:","description":"Chuck became available in the Starr Road.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"24/10/23","description":"Chuck no longer respawns with a fully charged Super.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"24/10/23","description":"Chuck's face texture was slightly reworked.","type":""}],"skins":[{"name":"Chuck","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/chuck/skins/Chuck/Default.png"},{"name":"Inferno","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/chuck/skins/Chuck/Inferno.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/chuck/skins/Chuck/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[4500,4950,5400,5850,6300,6750,7200,7650,8100,8550,9000],"attack":{"name":"Steam Engine","description":"Shoots a cloud of steam from Chuck's hat, piercing and damaging enemies.","stats":{"attackrange":"6.67 (Normal)","reload":"2 seconds (Slow)","attackbullets":"3","attacksupercharge":"13.5-6.75% (close to max range)","attackspeed":"1750"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage at min. range","list":[540,594,648,702,756,810,864,918,972,1026,1080]},{"name":"Damage at max. range","list":[270,297,324,351,378,405,432,459,486,513,540]}]},"super":{"name":"Choo-Choo!","description":"Dash to the nearest Post in line of sight, damaging enemies on the way.
