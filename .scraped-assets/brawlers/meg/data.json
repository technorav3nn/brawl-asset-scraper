However, her reload speed as well as movement speed is decreased in her Mecha. Because of this, it’s better not to chase down enemies in Bounty or Knockout.","Meg is an agile poker without her Mecha because of her fast movement speed and fast unload speed, but with it, she becomes a devastating fighter and control asset as she can deal high damage in large areas with her attack and secondary Super.","There's a slight delay before Meg hops into her Mecha, and her Super can be cancelled if she dies, gets knocked back, or gets stunned. Make sure to activate her Super where you'll be safe from attacking enemies.","In Brawl Ball, Meg can be very viable as a defense to oncoming opponents with the ball as her Mecha has a lot of health and can be used to significantly damage opponents. She can take enemy fire and provide some area denial to help the ball carrier score an easy goal.","In Showdown, Meg can be a force to be reckoned with due to her starting in her much stronger Mecha form. Combined with her Jolting Volts Gadget, Meg can duel even longer range Brawlers due to the Mecha's high health. However, Meg becomes much weaker after it is destroyed. Prioritize picking up Power Cubes and use her Force Field Star Power to increase Meg's survivability outside her Mecha.","When the various upgrades the Mecha gives Meg are needed more than usual, using Meg's Jolting Volts Gadget can keep Meg in her Mecha significantly longer against long range Brawlers that can prevent it from healing. This is useful in Heist because Meg will have a very low impact on the health of the Safe in her standard form, but can deal substantial damage onto the safe when inside her Mecha.","Be mindful when taking on high-responsibility roles such as the Gem carrier in Gem Grab or the ball carrier in Brawl Ball, because if Meg's Mecha is taken out, she will become an easy target.","Avoid close combat and engaging with aggressive Brawlers after her Mecha is destroyed. Either Star Power can help by shielding some damage or pushing away enemies near Meg, but those won't completely save her from taking damage or being defeated.","Meg's advanced Super will cancel its main attack. Keep this in mind if you want to deal substantial long-range damage."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"28/09/21:","description":"Meg was added to the game.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"30/09/21:","description":"Meg's Super is now lost if she is defeated while activating her Super.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"30/09/21:","description":"Meg now spawns with no ammo after her Mecha is destroyed (from 3).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"30/09/21:","description":"Meg now takes longer to start healing after her Mecha is destroyed.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"06/10/21:","description":"Fixed a bug where Meg's face texture would disappear when in her Mecha.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"13/10/21:","description":"Meg's Self Destruction Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"27/10/21:","description":"Meg now spawns with 1 ammo after her Mecha is destroyed (from 0).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"27/10/21:","description":"Meg's second Star Power was renamed to Heavy Metal (from Self Destruction).","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"27/10/21:","description":"Fixed an issue where Meg could use a teleporter again after activating her Super.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"25/01/22:","description":"Meg's Heavy Metal Star Power damage was increased to 1500 (from 1000).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"25/01/22:","description":"The number of hits necessary to charge Meg's Super was increased to 8 hits (from 6).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"02/03/22:","description":"Fixed a bug where Meg visually spawns as her Mecha after respawning.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"17/03/22:","description":"Fixed an issue where destroying Meg's Mecha could crash the game.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"07/04/22:","description":"The Beetle Meg skin was added.
