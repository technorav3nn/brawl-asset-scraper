Mico's reload speed is the slowest in the entire game, so avoid wasting too much ammo while using your attack for mobility.","To optimise the usage of Clipping Scream Gadget, jump directly onto opponents before using it, ensuring that all 3 projectiles hit. While this Gadget's slow should buy you time to escape, ensure to keep at least 1 ammo to escape.","You can also use Mico's Clipping Scream to slow down melee Brawlers trying to chase you down, allowing you to not have to use his main attack to jump away.","When engaging other Micos, it may be better to auto-aim right on top of them to deal damage. This is because many Mico confrontations will likely result in both parties trying to attack each other simultaneously and as such, it may be better to dodge at the last second and attack your opponent.","Keep in mind that Mico's Super slows down as it locks on, so try to corner Brawlers you target before you strike.","Mico's health is not extremely high and the 1 second delay to execute his Super leaves him vulnerable to defeat. As such, take advantage of the 6 second delay and use your Super behind cover before tracking your target.","Thanks to Mico's long airtime during his Super, he can use it similarly to Janet's Super in Gem Grab, escaping from opponents during the countdown as well as recovering in the air.","When engaging assassins, ensure you have at least one ammo to disengage. This is because, Mico lacks any real options for dealing high burst damage or recovering health, meaning that without his Clipping Scream Gadget, Mico cannot escape effectively and will likely be defeated.","Thanks to Mico's small damage radius, train to anticipate enemy movement, corner enemies into smaller bundles or use a more ambush-oriented fighting style. The latter style is best paired with his Monkey Business Star Power as it prevents brawlers with slow reload from fighting back, especially after confronting other brawlers.","Thanks to the long windup that Mico's Super possesses, try activating your Super immediately after using your Hypercharge to receive its effects, as otherwise it may run out while Mico's still airborne. Alternatively, the Hypercharge can be used purely to boost Mico's stats and not his Super.","Unlike other brawlers with similar attack-boosting bars, Mico’s Monkey Business bar recharges regardless of whether he’s attacking or not. As such, it’s recommended for Mico players to attack as soon as possible their bar is full, allowing for possible team wipes when Mico recharges during his attack.","Mico's attack damage is done a frame before the jump ends, making him immune to immediate damage retaliation from the likes of Jacky's Counter Crush or Meg's Heavy Metal Star Power. This applies to knockbacks as well, meaning Mico can damage enemies attempting to hide inside Gale's Twister Gadget."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Mico","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/mico/skins/Mico/Default.png"},{"name":"Macaron","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/mico/skins/Mico/Macaron.png"},{"name":"Grouch","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Dark Winter Tales","path":"/brawlers/mico/skins/Mico/Grouch.png"},{"name":"Wukong","cost":"299 Gems","campaign":"Lunar Brawl","path":"/brawlers/mico/skins/Mico/Wukong.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/mico/skins/Mico/"}],"hypercharge":[{"name":"Sound Check","description":"Mico's Super also stuns nearby enemies after landing for 1.5 seconds.","path":"/hypercharges/Sound%20Check.png"}],"healthByLevel":[3000,3300,3600,3900,4200,4500,4800,5100,5400,5700,6000],"attack":{"name":"Mic BOOM!","description":"Mico jumps forward for a short distance attacking with his mic boom and damaging nearby enemies after landing.","stats":{"attackrange":"4 (Short), 5.33 (with Presto)","reload":"2.6 seconds (Very Slow)","attacksupercharge":"20.71%","attackspeed":"3600"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage","list":[1090,1199,1308,1417,1526,1635,1744,1853,1962,2071,2180]}]},"super":{"name":"Out of Frame","description":"Mico jumps out of frame, becoming invulnerable while controlling his landing position and damaging nearby enemies while landing.","stats":{"supersupercharge":"14.875%","superduration":"6 seconds"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Landing Damage","list":[1190,1309,1428,1547,1666,1785,1904,2023,2142,2261,2380]}]},"model":{"path":"/brawlers/mico/model.png"},"avatar":{"path":"/brawlers/mico/avatar.png"}}
