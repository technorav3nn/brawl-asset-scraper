He can utilize this mechanic by pushing enemy Brawlers near a wall. Because his pickaxe will return faster after it hits the wall, Carl can do bursts of damage quickly, especially with his Power Throw Star Power, and he can utilize this to break Power Cube crates in Showdown. This can be highly effective in Heist where Carl can utilize walls near the enemy safe to deal consistent and quick damage.","Carl's Super does a lot of damage but at a short range. Be sure to get close to an enemy Brawler to maximize its damage, but it is advisable to avoid short-ranged Brawlers who deal damage quicker than Carl can.","When using Carl's Super offensively, make sure to pay attention to his Super's mechanics. Carl's Super doesn't have a shield-like Rosa's Super does, making him more likely to get burst down by enemies. However, if he has his Protective Pirouette Star Power, he can partially protect himself during one, though it's still never recommended to go near close-ranged Brawlers like Bull or El Primo with his Super to deal damage to them as they both deal great damage at close range, have high health and can use their Supers to interrupt or escape from Carl's Super.","Carl can't use his main attack while using his Super, but he can still use his Super while his pickaxe is still flying.","Carl's Super and Flying Hook Gadget can be used to get possession of the ball quicker than anyone else can. However, Carl cannot pick up the ball while using his Super.","Keep in mind that the pickaxe's returning ability may pose a disadvantage when attacking while traveling inside bushes. This gives the opponents ample time to perform prediction shots.","Carl's Super makes him have one of the fastest movement speeds in the game. Use this to escape (especially helpful with the Protective Pirouette Star Power as it lets him survive more shots) or to reach low-health enemies.","When Carl's pickaxe returns, it can go through walls and obstacles. This can be crucial when opponents only need one more hit to be defeated but are hiding behind a wall. He can take advantage of this by throwing his pickaxe and moving towards the enemy behind the wall before it returns allowing it to get an indirect hit.","Carl's Super can be interrupted by knockback or stun effects such as Gene's Super and Bibi's Home Run attack. Avoid using his Super offensively against Brawlers like these who can easily cancel his Super.","Carl's Heat Ejector Gadget can be used to block the path of incoming enemies in events such as Brawl Ball. It can also be paired with his Super to secure a lot of damage to the safe in Heist.","Carl's Flying Hook Gadget is useful for joining to action and retreating in events like Showdown, Gem Grab, and Siege, further helped by allowing him to travel over lakes and rope fences to a certain extent. It is also an excellent tool to counter defenseless Brawlers at close-quarters like Piper, especially if paired with his Super. It can also be used to escape from danger such as if you're ambushed (i.e. by Shelly).","An effective tactic is to use Carl's Flying Hook Gadget to get close to an enemy and then use your Super on them. This almost always will require his Protective Pirouette Star Power as most Brawlers have the means to defeat you, and can defeat almost all Brawlers except those with high health, with Protective Pirouette equipped."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Carl","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/carl/skins/Carl/Default.png"},{"name":"Goblin","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/carl/skins/Carl/Goblin.png"},{"name":"Road Rage","cost":"79 Gems","campaign":"Retropolis Nights","path":"/brawlers/carl/skins/Carl/Road%20Rage.png"},{"name":"Hog Rider","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","campaign":"Clash Stories","path":"/brawlers/carl/skins/Carl/Hog%20Rider.png"},{"name":"Leonard","cost":"79 Gems","campaign":"Brown & Friends","path":"/brawlers/carl/skins/Carl/Leonard.png"},{"name":"Dark Tide","cost":"79 Gems, available after purchasing Captain Carl","campaign":"Tales of the Sea","path":"/brawlers/carl/skins/Carl/Dark%20Tide.png"},{"name":"Captain","cost":"149 Gems","campaign":"Tales of the Sea","path":"/brawlers/carl/skins/Carl/Captain.png"},{"name":"Sultan","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Sands of Time","path":"/brawlers/carl/skins/Carl/Sultan.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/carl/skins/Carl/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/carl/skins/Carl/True%20Gold.png"},{"name":"Surfer","cost":"Brawl Pass Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/carl/skins/Carl/Surfer.png"},{"name":"Biker","cost":"Brawl Pass, 149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/carl/skins/Carl/Biker.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/carl/skins/Carl/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[4000,4400,4800,5200,5600,6000,6400,6800,7200,7600,8000],"attack":{"name":"Pickaxe","description":"Carl throws his Pickaxe like a boomerang.
