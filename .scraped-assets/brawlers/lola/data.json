Placing it close to her can allow them to do a large amount of damage to a single target and eliminate them faster. Alternatively, Lola can place it away from her to control a large area with her damage. This also removes the damage penalty of her Ego, causing it to pose more of a threat.","Although it will die much quicker, Lola can also throw her Ego in front of her and use it as a shield, blocking non piercing attacks, especially with the help of her Freeze Frame Gadget. This can be combined with the Health Gear to recover a good portion of health behind your Ego.","Lola can control multiple lanes with her Ego if played correctly. This is best used in Hot Zone, where her Ego provides a distraction for the enemy team.","It may be more advantageous to keep Lola without any ammo when she doesn’t need to heal when she has her Improvise Star Power, thus maximizing her burst damage.","Lola's Ego with her Freeze Frame Gadget can be used to attack enemies behind walls, especially throwers like Tick, Barley, or Sprout.","In Siege, Lola can use her Super and her Freeze Frame Gadget to temporarily delay the Siege Robot from attacking your team's IKE turret. Similarly, in Heist, Lola can place her Ego near the safe and activate Freeze Frame while standing behind it so you can deal damage while the Ego is shielded and can block enemy fire more effectively.","Lola's Freeze Frame Gadget can be used to reposition yourself to your desired location in relation to your Ego. For example, if you throw your Super and want to be on top of it, you can activate Freeze Frame to position yourself right on top of your Ego.","Lola can also reposition her Ego by moving such that her Ego runs into a wall. This way she can get closer to her Ego or position it to a desired position. A corner is very suitable in this situation. Stacking Lola's Ego on top of her allows for higher damage potential and consistency.","Lola's Ego can be used to have yourself attack enemies without the risk of being defeated yourself, such as throwing it next to the middle when starting off a Brawl Ball round, where more often than not, players frequently rush the middle."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"28/10/21:","description":"Lola became available to play in the Training Cave.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"08/11/21:","description":"Lola and Rebel Lola were added to the game.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"17/11/21:","description":"Lola's health was decreased to 3800 (from 4000).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"17/11/21:","description":"Lola's main attack damage was decreased to 260 (from 280) per projectile.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"17/11/21:","description":"Lola's facial animations were reworked.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"01/12/21:","description":"Lola's Sealed With a Kiss Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"16/12/21:","description":"Lola’s Super Ego now deals 50% less damage if it is less than 3.33 tiles away from Lola.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"01/03/22:","description":"Lola's Stunt Double Gadget was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"27/04/22:","description":"Lola and Rebel Lola's facial animations were reworked.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"27/04/22:","description":"Lola's True Silver and True Gold skins were added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"08/06/22:","description":"The Galaxy Storm Lola skin was added.
