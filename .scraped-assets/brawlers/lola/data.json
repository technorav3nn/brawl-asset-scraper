Placing it close to her can allow them to do a large amount of damage to a single target and eliminate them faster. Alternatively, Lola can place it away from her to control a large area with her damage. This also removes the damage penalty of her Ego, causing it to pose more of a threat.","Although it will die much quicker, Lola can also throw her Ego in front of her and use it as a shield, blocking non piercing attacks, especially with the help of her Freeze Frame Gadget. This can be combined with the Health Gear to recover a good portion of health behind your Ego.","Lola can control multiple lanes with her Ego if played correctly. This is best used in Hot Zone, where her Ego provides a distraction for the enemy team.","It may be more advantageous to keep Lola without any ammo when she doesn't need to heal when she has her Improvise Star Power, thus maximizing her burst damage.","Lola's Ego with her Freeze Frame Gadget can be used to attack enemies behind walls, especially throwers like Tick, Barley, or Sprout.","In Siege, Lola can use her Super and her Freeze Frame Gadget to temporarily delay the Siege Robot from attacking your team's IKE turret. Similarly, in Heist, Lola can place her Ego near the safe and activate Freeze Frame while standing behind it so you can deal damage while the Ego is shielded and can block enemy fire more effectively.","Lola's Freeze Frame Gadget can be used to reposition yourself to your desired location in relation to your Ego. For example, if you throw your Super and want to be on top of it, you can activate Freeze Frame to position yourself right on top of your Ego.","Lola can also reposition her Ego by moving such that her Ego runs into a wall. This way she can get closer to her Ego or position it to a desired position. A corner is very suitable in this situation. Stacking Lola's Ego on top of her allows for higher damage potential and consistency.","Lola's Ego can be used to have yourself attack enemies without the risk of being defeated yourself, such as throwing it next to the middle when starting off a Brawl Ball round, where more often than not, players frequently rush the middle."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Lola","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/lola/skins/Lola/Default.png"},{"name":"Galaxy Storm","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","campaign":"The Worst Bunch","path":"/brawlers/lola/skins/Lola/Galaxy%20Storm.png"},{"name":"Lawless","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Power League","path":"/brawlers/lola/skins/Lola/Lawless.png"},{"name":"Kitsune","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"The Ayakashi Clan","path":"/brawlers/lola/skins/Lola/Kitsune.png"},{"name":"Cobra","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Power League","path":"/brawlers/lola/skins/Lola/Cobra.png"},{"name":"Lavish","cost":"149 Gems","campaign":"Retropolis Nights","path":"/brawlers/lola/skins/Lola/Lavish.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/lola/skins/Lola/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/lola/skins/Lola/True%20Gold.png"},{"name":"Rebel","cost":"Brawl Pass Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/lola/skins/Lola/Rebel.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/lola/skins/Lola/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[3800,4180,4560,4940,5320,5700,6080,6460,6840,7220,7600],"attack":{"name":"Diamond Eyes","description":"Lola's favorite accessory is also her favorite weapon!
