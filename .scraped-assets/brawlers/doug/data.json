This strictly limits throwers that can otherwise take cover behind walls.","When aiming to defeat a specific enemy or group of enemies, Doug can simply use his Super and charge towards the group to attack, because getting defeated under the effects of the Super will not drop any collectibles that puts his team in a losing situation. Make sure to take note of the duration of his Super when using this strategy."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"25/07/23:","description":"Doug became available to play in the Training Cave.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"01/08/23:","description":"Doug and his Draco skin were added to the game.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"15/08/23:","description":"Doug's health was increased to 5000 (from 4800).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"15/08/23:","description":"His Super can now go through walls.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"15/08/23:","description":"Doug's Super now allows himself or allies to respawn with full health (from 50%).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"15/08/23:","description":"Doug's Super charge rate was decreased slightly.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"05/09/23:","description":"All Brawlers' health and damage were increased from 5% to 10% with each Power Level.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"24/10/23:","description":"Doug's Super range was increased to 9.33 tiles (from 6.67), and its width was increased to 1.33 tiles (from 0.33).","type":""}],"skins":[{"name":"Doug","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/doug/skins/Doug/Default.png"},{"name":"Draco","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/doug/skins/Doug/Draco.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/doug/skins/Doug/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[5000,5500,6000,6500,7000,7500,8000,8500,9000,9500,10000],"attack":{"name":"Snack Attack","description":"Fresh food for friends, expired for others.
