Enemies heading in the area will take high damage when they step on the traps. It can be utilized to cover the Gem mine in Gem Grab to damage enemy Brawlers who are gathering Gems from it. It can also be used to cover key choke points in Showdown, zone(s) in Hot Zone and Bolt spawning areas in Siege, making Bo an ideal control Brawler.","Bo's fairly high health can be used to walk the Ball into the enemy goal in Brawl Ball. In addition, Bo's traps can be used to destroy enemy cover and goalposts. Clearing up certain maps could be beneficial due to Bo's relatively long range, especially if he has teammates with long-ranged abilities. Hence, Bo is a viable Brawler in Brawl Ball.","Bo always shoots three arrows from left to right, so you can take advantage of this to control the spread of your arrows. If you want to concentrate fire in a small area, move left while firing, allowing more arrows to hit a single target. For an attack with more spread, move right. The space between each arrow will be increased, giving the attack a wider spread. However, the former strategy only works on stationary targets as Brawlers will most likely be moving and can thus dodge all three arrows.","Bo's Circling Eagle is really useful on maps filled with bushes, with his doubled radius of vision in bushes. Some maps include Cavern Churn, Feast or Famine, Island Invasion, Snake Prairie, and Sapphire Plains. Since you have a sight advantage, avoid getting close to tanks or other high-damaging Brawlers. Place his traps to cover the lane with only one passageway while you can cover the other side with your increased sight. When played properly, Bo can quite easily dominate bushy maps. This is really useful in 3v3, for his increased sight in bushes is shared with teammates too.","Bo's traps can knockback enemies, so if placed correctly, it can knock enemies into the poison gas in Showdown. With Bo's Snare a Bear, Bo's traps will instead stun, giving you ample time to quickly defeat opponents without any risk of dying, making this effective in Knockout, Lone Star, and Bounty. In Duo Showdown, Bo can be used with a high-damaging Brawler, such as Darryl or Shelly to finish off a stunned enemy.","Bo's traps can be lobbed over walls. This is great when you know there's a Brawler hiding in a bush opposite to you behind a wall. Throw it ahead of them, so they're forced to walk into it, as they cannot go through the wall unless they are airborne or have a destructive Super charged up. With the Tripwire Gadget, you can deal immediate damage to them.","Bo's Super Totem Gadget can be used near your team's spawn points to allow them to gain their Super before a team match. This also decreases the chance of the enemy team destroying your totem.","Bo's Snare a Bear Star Power can come into great effect in several Special Events. If one is stunned, you and your teammates can deal massive damage to them temporarily without being targeted. This includes the Bosses in Super City Rampage, Robo Rumble and Boss Fight.","When an enemy tries to disarm your traps, use Bo's Tripwire Gadget to catch them off guard and deal instant damage. Coupled with Bo's second Star Power, Bo can passively force enemies to not disarm his mines. This allows him to control open areas simply by selecting this Gadget.","When Bo's Super is used, the third trap is set slightly after the other two. Thus, activating Bo's Tripwire Gadget immediately after using his Super only explodes two traps. In Brawl Ball, this can be used to explode walls or obstacles in front of the enemies' goal effectively, which makes it much easier to score. This also leaves one trap hidden until an enemy steps on it, so you can use the last trap for other strategies such as bait for the Ball.","Try to use Bo's Tripwire Gadget before the enemy steps onto it, since the 1.5 second delay allows the enemy to escape. Also, note that the 1.5 second delay takes longer than its normal 1.15 seconds.","If Bo manages to place his mines on the IKE turret in Siege or on the Heist safe, he can activate Tripwire as soon as he can to deal immediate high damage to the safe/IKE turret.","Only use Super Totem in rather passive events like Bounty and Showdown where you can get the objective by simply by camping (in this case, near the totem to charge your Supers). Use Tripwire in other events that require you to achieve an active objective like Gem Grab and Siege because you can't afford to stay near the totem for a long time when you should be working towards the objective of the game (in which, in the above examples, is collecting Gems and Siege Bolts), and you should make use of the control abilities Tripwire offers."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Bo","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/bo/skins/Bo/Default.png"},{"name":"Warrior","cost":"Free from the Duo Showdown challenge of 2021, 29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/bo/skins/Bo/Warrior.png"},{"name":"Supreme","cost":"49 Gems, available after purchasing Brother Bo","campaign":"Warrior's Journey","path":"/brawlers/bo/skins/Bo/Supreme.png"},{"name":"Light Mecha","cost":"49 Gems, available after purchasing Mecha Bo","campaign":"Mecha Squad","path":"/brawlers/bo/skins/Bo/Light%20Mecha.png"},{"name":"Gold Mecha","cost":"49 Gems, available after purchasing Mecha Bo","campaign":"Mecha Squad","path":"/brawlers/bo/skins/Bo/Gold%20Mecha.png"},{"name":"Ho Ho Ho","cost":"79 Gems","campaign":"Brawlidays","path":"/brawlers/bo/skins/Bo/Ho%20Ho%20Ho.png"},{"name":"Horus","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Supercell Make","path":"/brawlers/bo/skins/Bo/Horus.png"},{"name":"Underworld","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Supercell Make","path":"/brawlers/bo/skins/Bo/Underworld.png"},{"name":"Wasp","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Ranked","path":"/brawlers/bo/skins/Bo/Wasp.png"},{"name":"Brother","cost":"199 Gems","campaign":"Warrior's Journey","path":"/brawlers/bo/skins/Bo/Brother.png"},{"name":"Mecha","cost":"299 Gems","campaign":"Mecha Squad","path":"/brawlers/bo/skins/Bo/Mecha.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/bo/skins/Bo/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/bo/skins/Bo/True%20Gold.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/bo/skins/Bo/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[3600,3960,4320,4680,5040,5400,5760,6120,6480,6840,7200],"attack":{"name":"Eagle-Eyed","description":"Bo releases a trio of exploding arrows, tearing up enemies like an eagle's talons.","stats":{"attackrange":"8.67 (Long)","reload":"1.7 seconds (Normal), 1.445 seconds (with Reload Gear)","attackbullets":"3","attacksupercharge":"12%, 18% (with Super Totem)","attackspread":"15Â°","attackspeed":"2800"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage per arrow","list":[640,704,768,832,896,960,1024,1088,1152,1216,1280]}]},"super":{"name":"Super Totem","description":"Bo places a totem that increases allies' Super charging rate by 50%.
