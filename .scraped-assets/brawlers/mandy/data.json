Hide in bushes or behind walls to protect yourself.","Beware of Buster's Super, as her attacks and Super get absorbed by it. However, only her attack will be converted into a counter projectile.","In Heist, you can charge up her Super to attack straight your enemy safe and Brawlers at the same time. On Safe Zone, when you have charged your Super, you can shoot it down the middle of the map and damage the Safe and enemy Brawlers.","Mandy is able to deal a lot of damage to her enemies' safe by aligning herself to her team's safe and aiming her Super towards her enemies' safe.","Use her Super in a bush or off-screen so that enemies won't suspect it. Point it at choke-points across the map where enemies would frequently camp at, like the small bushes in Riverside and the small gap near the wall in Out in the Open.","Do make sure not to waste Mandy's ammo. Even though her reload speed is better than many sharpshooters, do note that she has no escape tactics besides her Caramelize Gadget, which won't work in point-blank range. She also doesn't have a lot of health, so the only way is to use her attacks and/or Super for defense.","A trick you can learn with Mandy is: when Mandy stands still, the moment her focus bar is charged, quickly fire a shot and immediately retreat. This can be more useful with her In My Sights Star Power, and is a good tactic when used in conjunction with either of her gadgets and the Damage Gear. This is useful when you are at low health but still want to maintain control of the map.","While she lacks a high health pool or any knockback/pullback utilities, Mandy is a good defensive option for Volley Brawl as her range increases when she stands still, allowing her to defend the landing site of the volleyball more efficiently, especially couple with her Hard Candy Star Power. Her Caramelize Gadget can also be used to slow down the opposing team, preventing them from reaching the volleyball's landing site in time, and her Super can be used effectively to force the opposing team to scatter or defeat anybody at the volleyball's landing site."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"26/12/22:","description":"Mandy became available to play in the Training Cave.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"02/01/23:","description":"Mandy, her Magma, and her MC skins were added to the game.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"12/01/23:","description":"Mandy's Focus bar now charges in 0.45 seconds (from 0.75).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"12/01/23:","description":"Fixed a bug where Mandy's Super would glitch when traveling outside of maps.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"20/01/23:","description":"Mandy's Cookie Crumbs Gadget and Hard Candy Star Power were added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"28/02/23:","description":"Mandy's class was changed to Marksman (from Damage Dealer).","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"28/02/23:","description":"Mandy's True Silver and True Gold skins were added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"27/06/23:","description":"Mandy's Hard Candy Star Power damage reduction was increased to 30% (from 20%).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"05/09/23:","description":"Mandy's main attack damage was increased to 1300 (from 1200).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"05/09/23:","description":"All Brawlers' health and damage were increased from 5% to 10% with each Power Level.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"05/09/23:","description":"Fixed an issue with Mandy's candy dispenser.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"26/09/23:","description":"The Hanbok Mandy skin was added.
