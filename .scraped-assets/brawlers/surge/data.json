Whether or not you have his Serve Ice Cold Star Power, you should charge up your Super as soon as you can and use it to get the speed boost he needs to make up for his rather short range. Don't be hesitant to use his Super as a defensive tool, as without his first upgrade, Surge lacks any offensive ability due to his slow speed and short range. After getting his first upgrade, Supers can either be saved if you're playing against assassins or heavyweights who could ambush you at close range or used immediately if you're playing against longer-ranged Brawlers who could out-range you since his second upgrade increases his range. In Showdown, it's necessary to get his second upgrade because he'll need it match sharpshooters in more open maps. An effective Duo Showdown composition would be Surge and Bo as Bo can drop his Super Totem to help Surge charge his Super in one less hit and allow Surge to get some of his much needed upgrades.","Surge can momentarily dodge any projectiles approaching him while using his Super. Use his Super at the right moment to avoid a potentially devastating projectile; for example, Surge can evade Frank's destructive Super by activating his Super right after Frank winds up his hammer. Alternatively, his Super can be used in close-ranged combat as landing his Super on an enemy within a small radius deals damage and also knocks them back. If a close-ranged Brawler is chasing Surge, his Super can be used to physically distance Surge from his enemy and to deter the enemy by dishing out some extra damage.","Once he reaches Stage 3, Surge's Super shouldn't be used immediately after charging it. It will not upgrade him any further, so it's better to save it until he needs it. It can later be used when he needs to dodge attacks or to escape from a Brawler that gets too close.","In Showdown, try saving your Super even if you're not at Stage 3. Surge's Super is a vital tool for him to survive in Showdown especially if you're up against assassins and other Brawlers that can get dangerously close to you.","At his initial stage, Surge is an easy target for throwers. Staying out of range or simply avoiding throwers increases Surge's chance of survival until he reaches Stage 1. After upgrading himself for the first time, Surge can counter their attacks with his very fast movement speed, which quickly turns him into a threat.","In 3v3 Events, such as Brawl Ball, conserving a charged Super until you respawn can provide a vital speed boost immediately, allowing Surge to easily get back into action. Speed is also required in this mode to score goals; Surge's Serve Ice Cold gives him the speed needed to dodge attacks, get close to enemies, and score goals.","When using Surge's first gadget Power Surge, your goal should be to get a Super during the time limit as to pump up when the duration is over, as well taking advantage of your new benefit while you can. An example would be to use your speed (If used in base stage) to aggressively pressure opponents.","Surge's To the Max! Star Power is particularly effective in Showdown. On certain Showdown maps such as Rockwall Brawl and Cavern Churn, there are long lanes and cramped walls that Surge can utilize to split his shots. To the Max! is extremely powerful if Surge is fully upgraded, as his shots split into 6 instead of 2, making him an immediate threat combined with his high burst damage and Power Surge Gadget. Itâ€™s mainly used to hit enemies at walls, and can deal extraordinary damage if all shots, main and split, hit.","His Serve Ice Cold Star Power is completely useless in Solo Showdown and dubious in Duo Showdown, because it is only activated once Surge is defeated. To the Max! gives better value overall because the split shots from hitting a wall can help aid Surge gain his Super quickly without having to use his Gadgets to gain his pivotal upgrades.","When fighting another Brawler as Surge, it's extremely important to consider what options they have to counter you. Surge is best played when he can achieve easy kills with 3 ammo, but Surge has relatively low health. Playing Surge opportunistically and making calculated decisions especially with his Power Surge Gadget results in Surge being very fearsome to fight against. Get close enough to enemies and only then attack, as Surge reloads painfully slow and has low health, so wasting ammo should be avoided.","In bush-filled maps like Snake Prairie, Surge can easily get Supers and dominate the match by bush-camping and bursting down enemies who approach the bush. Since his Super charges in three shots, he can continuously get Supers."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Surge","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/surge/skins/Surge/Default.png"},{"name":"DIY","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","path":"/brawlers/surge/skins/Surge/DIY.png"},{"name":"Surge Kong","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","campaign":"Starrs of Brawlywood","path":"/brawlers/surge/skins/Surge/Surge%20Kong.png"},{"name":"Kraken","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Supercell Make","path":"/brawlers/surge/skins/Surge/Kraken.png"},{"name":"Surgenie","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Sands of Time","path":"/brawlers/surge/skins/Surge/Surgenie.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/surge/skins/Surge/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/surge/skins/Surge/True%20Gold.png"},{"name":"Mecha Paladin","cost":"Brawl Pass Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/surge/skins/Surge/Mecha%20Paladin.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/surge/skins/Surge/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[3300,3630,3960,4290,4620,4950,5280,5610,5940,6270,6600],"attack":{"name":"Juice of Justice","description":"Surge serves a shot of Juice that splits in two on contact with enemies.","stats":{"attackrange":"6.67 (Normal), 8.67 (stage, 2+; Long)","reload":"2 seconds (Slow)","attacksupercharge":"35.4%, 17.7% (split)","attackspeed":"3500, 3000 (split)","attackwidth":"1"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage","list":[1180,1298,1416,1534,1652,1770,1888,2006,2124,2242,2360]},{"name":"Split Damage","list":[590,649,708,767,826,885,944,1003,1062,1121,1180]}]},"super":{"name":"Party Tricks","description":"With each Super, Surge gets upgraded (MAX 3).
