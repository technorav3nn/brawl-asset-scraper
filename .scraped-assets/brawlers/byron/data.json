However, with his fast projectile speed, aiming with Byron is easier than with other long-ranged Brawlers such as Brock or Bea. Unless there are no enemies near faraway allies, prioritize allies closest to you.","To take advantage of Byron's range is to chip away at enemies with his stacking tick damage while also dodging their fire, and once they're low on health, you can use your Super to finish them off. This strategy will allow Byron to better secure defeats.","Byron's long range, high tick damage, and healing abilities truly shine in Team Events because he can consistently heal his teammates and himself with his attack, Super, and Shot In the Arm Gadget alike while they work towards the event objective with the healing giving more ease. Doing so will almost guarantee a positive outcome as the healing decreases enemy damage while assisting allies. In addition, he's also effective at preventing enemies from healing, making it easier to cripple the enemy team.","Byron is outstanding at supporting close-ranged Brawlers like Edgar as Byron's allies can play aggressively, and if applicable, ambush enemies with their Supers or by bush-camping while Byron can consistently and quickly heal them from a safe distance.","When your attack is auto-aimed, it prioritizes the closest target to you. When fighting alongside a teammate, manually aim to hit the enemy and keep your distance, and even if you have his Injection Star Power, which allows you to chain attacks to hit both allies and enemies, you should still maintain a safe distance away from teammates that is far enough to damage enemies but close enough to heal allies without the disadvantages of long-range aiming.","Byron functions well with 8-Bit as 8-Bit's damage booster boosts Byron's healing abilities and Byron can use this to heal 8-Bit who already has high health. This combination is very effective in Duo Showdown. The combo is also extremely devastating in Siege; if the team dives into the enemy IKE turret's range to attack it, the boosted healing from Byron will momentarily protect 8-Bit while he uses his high damage and his Extra Credits Gadget to take out a major portion, if not all, of the IKE's health. Conversely, these two Brawlers in an enemy team should be monitored closely and be approached with caution.","Byron is niche in Super City Rampage as he can heal allies while they aggressively attack the Boss. An excellent team composition in this event is himself with his Injection Star Power, Pam, and one who can stall the Boss such as Edgar/Nita. For Edgar, he should use his Fisticuffs Star Power; for Nita, she should use her Bear With Me Star Power. If Edgar is the stalling Brawler, he should continuously stall the Boss with his high burst damage and the healing provided from his attack, Pam and Byron, and these should make him able to overcome the Boss's damage. For Nita, she should charge up her Super and spawn Bruce near the Boss opposite of Nita, and Nita and Bruce should take turns attacking and healing each other, and with Pam's and Byron's healing, Nita and Bruce can withstand more damage.","Byron's Booster Shots Gadget is best used to poison multiple enemies, heal multiple allies, or a combination of the two. It can also be used to heal or poison a single target for more damage/health than a regular shot, and can act as a form of close-range defense in combination with his Super. The gadget is good for killing low health enemies up close, although sometimes byron will die too when he uses it up close."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Byron","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/byron/skins/Byron/Default.png"},{"name":"Wizard","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Power League","path":"/brawlers/byron/skins/Byron/Wizard.png"},{"name":"Overlord","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"The Worst Bunch","path":"/brawlers/byron/skins/Byron/Overlord.png"},{"name":"Ringmaster","cost":"199 Gems","campaign":"Bizarre Circus","path":"/brawlers/byron/skins/Byron/Ringmaster.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/byron/skins/Byron/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/byron/skins/Byron/True%20Gold.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/byron/skins/Byron/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[2400,2640,2880,3120,3360,3600,3840,4080,4320,4560,4800],"attack":{"name":"Careful Dose","description":"Shoots a long range dart that can hit both opponents and friendlies.
