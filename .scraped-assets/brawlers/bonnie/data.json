{"id":"bonnie","url":"https://brawlstars.fandom.com/wiki/Bonnie","name":"Bonnie","directory":"/brawlers/bonnie/","description":"Bonnie is a bundle of uncontrollable and totally destructive energy. Her dream is to be fired from her cannon, all the way to the moon!","stats":{"rarity":"Epic","class":"Marksman","movementspeed":"620 (Clyde; Slow), 806 (with Sugar Rush), 820 (Bonnie; Very Fast)","voiceactor":"Bindy Coda"},"gadgets":[],"starpowers":[],"tips":["In Bonnie's cannon form, she can pressure enemies due to her long attack range and high health. In her alternate form, Bonnie can pick off enemy Brawlers with her high burst damage. But since she has a short range in her alternate form, her Super with her Black Powder Star Power allows her to get close to enemies. Try not to rush into a group of enemies in Bonnie's alternate form, as despite having a very fast movement speed, her short range and moderately low health makes it risky to run away from or towards enemy Brawlers, who could easily corner or outrange her.","Speed and Damage are two fitting Gears for Bonnie. Speed can help provide extra agility in her Cannon form and can help Bonnie close in on enemies in her close range form. Damage, on the other hand, helps her deal extra damage in her cannon form, seeing how much health she has in her Clyde form, and helps her deal a lot of extra damage in her close range Bonnie form, since she acts like an assassin.","In her Bonnie form, Bonnie has very slow reload speed and short range, so it is a bad idea to waste ammo to \"tag\" or intimidate an opponent if you are under attack.","Bonnie's attacks are similar to Bo's attacks. Bonnie shoots three bombs from left to right, so you can take advantage of this to control the spread of the bombs. If you want to concentrate fire in a small area, move left while firing, allowing more arrows to hit a single target. For an attack with more spread, move right. The space between each bomb will be increased, giving the attack a wider spread.","Use your Super to gain some health back if you're on low health.","Bonnie can be good in Heist or Siege, as once she has her Super charged, she can use it to jump on the safe or the IKE turret and unleash all three ammo, dealing some 12440 damage to the target. This can take out about 25% of the IKE turret's health before she's knocked down by it in Siege, and she can stay in the fight longer with healers like Byron or Poco.","Use the Cannon form if you're fighting against long-range enemies, as it gives you a long range and high health. Conversely, it is better to use the alternate form when fighting short-range enemies, as they usually have high health and the alternate form does a lot of damage. If they hit you, you can quickly escape because of her high movement speed."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Clyde","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/bonnie/skins/Clyde/Default.png"},{"name":"Unicorn","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/bonnie/skins/Clyde/Unicorn.png"},{"name":"FootBonnie","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","campaign":"Golden Brawl Ball","path":"/brawlers/bonnie/skins/Clyde/FootBonnie.png"},{"name":"Empress","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"The Worst Bunch","path":"/brawlers/bonnie/skins/Clyde/Empress.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/bonnie/skins/Clyde/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/bonnie/skins/Clyde/True%20Gold.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/bonnie/skins/Clyde/"},{"name":"Bonnie","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/bonnie/skins/Bonnie/Default.png"},{"name":"Unicorn","path":"/brawlers/bonnie/skins/Bonnie/Unicorn.png"},{"name":"FootBonnie","campaign":"Golden Brawl Ball","path":"/brawlers/bonnie/skins/Bonnie/FootBonnie.png"},{"name":"Empress","campaign":"The Worst Bunch","path":"/brawlers/bonnie/skins/Bonnie/Empress.png"},{"name":"True Silver","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/bonnie/skins/Bonnie/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/bonnie/skins/Bonnie/True%20Gold.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/bonnie/skins/Bonnie/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[4800,5280,5760,6240,6720,7200,7680,8160,8640,9120,9600],"attack":{"name":"Attacks","stats":{"attackrange":"9 (Clyde; Long), 5 (Bonnie; Normal)","reload":"1 second (Clyde; Very Fast), 0.7 seconds (with Sugar Rush), 2 seconds (Bonnie; Slow)","attackbullets":"1 (Clyde), 3 (Bonnie)","attacksupercharge":"25% (Clyde), 27.5% (with Super Charge Gear), 6.25% (with Wisdom Tooth), 6.875% (with Wisdom Tooth and Super Charge Gear)","attackspread":"20ยบ (Bonnie)","attackspeed":"3800 (Clyde), 3261 (Bonnie)","attackwidth":"1 (Clyde)"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage (Clyde)","list":[1000,1100,1200,1300,1400,1500,1600,1700,1800,1900,2000]},{"name":"Damage per grenade (Bonnie)","list":[580,638,696,754,812,870,928,986,1044,1102,1160]}]},"super":{"name":"Supers","stats":{"superrange":"7.33, 10 (with Black Powder)","superspeed":"3000"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage on landing","list":[1000,1100,1200,1300,1400,1500,1600,1700,1800,1900,2000]},{"name":"Bonnie Health","list":[3000,3300,3600,3900,4200,4500,4800,5100,5400,5700,6000]}]},"model":{"path":"/brawlers/bonnie/model.png"},"avatar":{"path":"/brawlers/bonnie/avatar.png"}}
