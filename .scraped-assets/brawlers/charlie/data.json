Because of this, when facing a Penny in Duo Showdown or 3v3, it is better to not be close to the cocoon.","The cocoon can be used for a teammate like Shelly to catch up and wait for the enemy to be released. After that, the teammate can quickly burst and kill the enemy.","Since Charlie's attack comes back after hitting one target, it is more reliable to use auto-aim than Carl.","Charlie's Super can cancel out any Super, so when a Brawler like Bull or Chuck is attempting to come towards you/your team, you can use her Super to save you and/or your teammates from harm.","Using the Super when someone that is chasing you also gives you time to heal up.","Charlie's Spiders Gadget can be used to follow enemies that are hiding in bushes. It can also be used to tank shots from single target Brawlers such as Piper or Bea.","Charlie's Super can be used in Gem Grab to disarm the Gem carrier, which makes them drop the Gems. In Brawl Ball, her Super is handy, as she can disarm the ball carrier.","Since Charlie's ammo reloads after her yo-yo returns, she attacks much quicker at close range. This makes her an effective counter to short range brawlers like Mortis. If the enemy is a longer range brawler, using her Super can allow her to close the distance on them and do very high damage to them once they escape."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Charlie","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/charlie/skins/Charlie/Default.png"},{"name":"Amazing","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/charlie/skins/Charlie/Amazing.png"},{"name":"Rosie","cost":"Brawl Pass Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/charlie/skins/Charlie/Rosie.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/charlie/skins/Charlie/"}],"hypercharge":[{"name":"Pestilence","description":"Cocoon spawns 3 spiders that seek and attack the nearest enemies.","path":"/hypercharges/Pestilence.png"}],"healthByLevel":[3300,3630,3960,4290,4620,4950,5280,5610,5940,6270,6600],"attack":{"name":"Yo-yo","description":"Charlie slings her yo-yo forward, damaging the first enemy hit and then returning back to her.","stats":{"attackrange":"9 (Long)","attacksupercharge":"18%","attackspeed":"4200","attackwidth":"1"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage","list":[800,880,960,1040,1120,1200,1280,1360,1440,1520,1600]}]},"super":{"name":"Cocoon","description":"Charlie throws forward a bundle of hair wrapping around an enemy on hit, disabling them until the hairy cocoon is destroyed.","stats":{"superrange":"9 (Long)","superspeed":"3300","superwidth":"1.33","superduration":"5 seconds"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Cocoon Health","list":[4200,4620,5040,5460,5880,6300,6720,7140,7560,7980,8400]}]},"model":{"path":"/brawlers/charlie/model.png"},"avatar":{"path":"/brawlers/charlie/avatar.png"}}
