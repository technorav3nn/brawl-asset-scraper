Prioritize his Super on farther enemies to deal more damage, recharge more of his Super, and give a sufficient amount of time to reposition himself so that the banknotes hit enemies while they’re returning.","Griff struggles in long-ranged combat due to his slow unload speed. His attack does deal high damage, but its full potential requires Griff to be at close range. However, Griff can still be effective at long-ranged combat if he attacks enemies at the tip of his range, where he can hit most of or all of the coins.","Griff's Keep the Change Star Power offers him more protection against close-ranged Brawlers since he’s able to attack faster. Griff’s Super can be combined with his attack to defend against those Brawlers.","Griff's Super can force enemies out of where it travelled. You can use this for area denial such as blocking off the zones in Hot Zone, the Gem mine in Gem Grab, or the Bolt spawns in Siege.","Griff's attack and Super’s high damage output coupled with his reasonable reload speed make him viable in Heist. Griff's Keep The Change Star Power compensates for his slow unload speed, which allows him to consistently attack the safe, and his Piggy Bank Gadget is useful in defense and offense to knock enemies away from the team’s safe or to deal extra damage to the enemy safe.","If enemies are hiding and taking cover behind obstacles, you can use his Piggy Bank Gadget to destroy the obstacles and burst them down afterwards.","Griff’s Super has high burst damage regardless of range. Because of this, his Super can be used in a lot of situations such as using it to devastate enemies directly, keeping close-ranged enemies away from you, or to quickly defeat enemy Gem carriers in Gem Grab. Griff's Super is still active even if he is defeated, dealing a little more damage and allowing for some Super recharge after being defeated","Griff’s Business Resilience Star Power will heal you even when you’re attacking or taking damage. You can use this to heal while fighting, which makes it more difficult for enemies to defeat you, or to heal while working towards a mode objective as enemies will be attacking you while doing so.","Try to hit at least 2 or more opponents with his Super, as this will give Griff back more of his Super, and put most Brawlers into a range in which they can be finished off with Griff's main attack or another Super. This is rather easy to do due to the long range and wide spread of Griff's Super."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Griff","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/griff/skins/Griff/Default.png"},{"name":"High Score","cost":"79 Gems","campaign":"Lunar Brawl","path":"/brawlers/griff/skins/Griff/High%20Score.png"},{"name":"Sleigher","cost":"149 Gems","campaign":"Brawlidays","path":"/brawlers/griff/skins/Griff/Sleigher.png"},{"name":"Sunken Chest","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Cursed Pirates","path":"/brawlers/griff/skins/Griff/Sunken%20Chest.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/griff/skins/Griff/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/griff/skins/Griff/True%20Gold.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/griff/skins/Griff/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[3400,3740,4080,4420,4760,5100,5440,5780,6120,6460,6800],"attack":{"name":"Coin Toss","description":"Angry Griff pelts opponents with coins.
