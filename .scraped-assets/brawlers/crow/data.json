This allows him to constantly apply poison and regular damage on enemies, preventing them from healing and charging up his Super all the while.","His Super is a fitting assassination tool. Once a Brawler is on low health because of the poison, he can jump on them for a quick defeat. Because the daggers fly out around him, you should position yourself to land onto an enemy, which maximizes the Super's potential. Crow's Super also is a viable escape tool. If he is low on health with enemies approaching, you can use his Super to fly away and escape while also damaging the enemies. His Defense Booster Gadget enables better survivability while using his Super, and his Slowing Toxin Gadget also prevents enemies from chasing Crow or retreating from Crow's Super. This works best with close-ranged Brawlers, as they'll be poisoned and can't reach him to attack him due to Crow's relatively long range. Due to this, Crow excels in modes like Takedown, Knockout and Duo Showdown.","Crow's poison prevents the poisoned Brawler from self-healing for 4 seconds more than the normal healing time (3 seconds), raising the required time for auto-regeneration to be 7 seconds instead (similar to El Primo's El Fuego Star Power) since the poison enables damage for an extended period. This exponentially hinders an enemy's ability to regroup with allies and/or recover health. The poison also reveals the enemy when they are inside bushes, so it also prevents enemies inflicted with poison from hiding and healing. For this reason, Crow is a great poker that can finish off low-health enemies or continuously prevent isolated Brawler from healing and force them to retreat.","To use Crow is to take advantage of his range by poking at the enemy. Attack from a distance and back off to chip away at an enemy's health and charge his Super. While poking, use Crow's fast movement speed to dodge enemy fire. Although poking deals moderate damage each time, especially because other Brawlers are more effective in long-ranged combat than Crow, poking will slowly defeat the enemy and hinder any healing.","Crow's Super can be useful for Brawl Ball. When Crow has the ball and his Super, he can self-pass by kicking the ball in front of him, and then use his Super to jump past other Brawlers and retrieve the ball, and then attempt to score.","Crow's Extra Toxic Star Power reduces damage dealt by poisoned enemies. This also works on IKE turrets, Boss Fight Robots, and Big Game Bosses, making them overall less effective in the long run, and increasing his team's survivability.","Crow's Carrion Crow Star Power allows Crow to pick off low-health enemies with ease. Allow your allies to bring an enemy to half health, then poke them down until they're defeated, and the damage boost should allow this to be done quicker than usual.","Whenever playing him on Showdown with the Angry Robo Modifier, it's not recommended to play solo as Crow can't deal high damage to the Boss by himself; playing Duo Showdown with a high-damaging teammate is much more ideal.","An advanced aiming tactic is to hit 2 daggers at medium range from an enemy by aiming slightly to the edges. This gets easier the closer an enemy is to him. However, at a certain point, it's simply better to quickfire so all 3 daggers hit a target.","Crow is niche in offense-oriented modes such as Showdown, and his effectiveness in these modes is amplified with his Star Powers. Since surviving while defeating the enemies is the top priority in these modes, Extra Toxic reducing an enemy's damage is a viable tactic. Since Extra Toxic's effect is percentage-based, it also scales with a target's damage, making him better against heavyweights or enemies with a high amount of Power Cubes. Meanwhile, Carrion Crow can be very strong in 1v1 interactions. Early into the game where Power Cubes aren't abundant, Carrion Crow can provide crucial damage required to eliminate an enemy early. The Star Power of choice ultimately depends on play style: Extra Toxic is better for a sustained, controlled game of Showdown while Carrion Crow is better for an aggressive play style that capitalizes on early eliminations.","Crow's Defense Booster Gadget should be activated after using Crow's Super to get more value and to be able to play aggressively. His Slowing Toxin Gadget, however, should be activated right before using Crow's Super to block mobility to escape from Crow's Super.","Keep in mind how many daggers and/or poison damage Crow requires for his Super. Knowing this can help you decide when to jump to eliminate an enemy and whether you should continue pursuing them as your target.","Crow is highly vulnerable to assassins with high-mobility, such as Mortis and Edgar, at close range without his Super or help from allies. In these scenarios, it's best to group with them. Attack them at a range, and when they get close, quickly group with a teammate with high damage at close range, such as Shelly and Bull, who could potentially protect him and potentially defeat the enemy.","A good strategy in Showdown is to play as a third-party (waiting for a fight to end, defeating the winner, and stealing all of the Power Cubes). You can ramp up Cubes quickly with this strategy. As Crow, you should keep enemies who are on low health after a fight poisoned continuously until they are defeated, since Crow is incapable of dealing high damage immediately.","Before using his Slowing Toxin gadget in 3v3s, make sure that more than 1 target is currently poisoned. For the best use, poison all the three enemies and then use the gadget to slow all the enemies to make way for teamwipes.","An effective strategy is to pair with a Brawler like Colette, Surge, or Piper (at a range) who can bring an enemy down to low health very quickly, and then use his poison and Super to eliminate them without risk of getting defeated. This works very well in modes like Duo Showdown."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"16/08/17:","description":"Crow's main attack and Super damage was increased to 80 (from 60) per
