If you spawn your twin brother Lawrie towards the enemy they might play less aggressive considering you're the main target. Thus, you can swap places given the right opponent and fast attack them unexpectedly.","Lawrie is also very useful in other game modes, such as Bounty, Wipeout, and Gem Grab, as he puts pressure on the enemy team and helps your team gaining map control.","Their first Star Power is useful to defend against aggressive melee Brawlers like Fang or El Primo, making it a hard task to take him down. Against area damage brawlers like Edgar, keep some distance between you and Lawrie to ensure that Lawrie will not take double damage from their attacks."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Larry","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/larry_%26_lawrie/skins/Larry/Default.png"},{"name":"Larry & Lawrie Controllers","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/larry_%26_lawrie/skins/Larry/Larry%20%26%20Lawrie%20Controllers.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/larry_&_lawrie/skins/Larry/"},{"name":"Lawrie","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/larry_%26_lawrie/skins/Lawrie/Default.png"},{"name":"Larry & Lawrie Controllers","path":"/brawlers/larry_%26_lawrie/skins/Lawrie/Larry%20%26%20Lawrie%20Controllers.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/larry_&_lawrie/skins/Lawrie/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[3000,3300,3600,3900,4200,4500,4800,5100,5400,5700,6000],"attack":{"name":"Ticket Dispenser","description":"Shoot a ticket bundle over obstacles that explodes twice after landing, damaging nearby enemies.","stats":{"attackrange":"7.33 (Long), 6.67 (with Order: Swap)","reload":"2.2 seconds (Slow)","attacksupercharge":"12.5%","attackspread":"13° (with Order: Swap)","attackspeed":"2000, 3400 (with Order: Swap)"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage per second","list":[700,770,840,910,980,1050,1120,1190,1260,1330,1400]}]},"super":{"name":"Call For Backup","description":"Throw a signal to summon your twin Lawrie for help.
