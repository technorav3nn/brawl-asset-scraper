Instead, use the Super on isolated enemies to allow your teammates to finish them off, or onto low health enemies to defeat them.","Kit is a decent choice in Showdown as he can chain Supers indefinitely once he has obtained a moderate number of Power Cubes. This process is easier and quicker with his Power Hungry Star Power, and once he has acquired around six Power Cubes, he will dominate the match. He works better in Duo Showdown as he can heal his teammates, control and damage his enemies while being invulnerable, and acquire double Power Cube buffs. His Cardboard Box Gadget is also useful, as it allows him to speed up his Super charge rate, sneak up on enemies, or flee from enemies."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Kit","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/kit/skins/Kit/Default.png"},{"name":"Billy the","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/kit/skins/Kit/Billy%20the.png"},{"name":"KitBoxer","cost":"Brawl Pass Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/kit/skins/Kit/KitBoxer.png"},{"name":"KitBoxer Darkpaw","cost":"Brawl Pass Plus Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/kit/skins/Kit/KitBoxer%20Darkpaw.png"},{"name":"KitBoxer Goldpaw","cost":"Brawl Pass Plus Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/kit/skins/Kit/KitBoxer%20Goldpaw.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/kit/skins/Kit/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[3000,3300,3600,3900,4200,4500,4800,5100,5400,5700,6000],"attack":{"name":"Attacks","stats":{"attackrange":"3.67 (Short), 7.33 (attached)","reload":"0.8 seconds (Very Fast), 2 seconds (attached)","attacksupercharge":"20%","attackspread":"75Â°","attackspeed":"1900"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage","list":[800,880,960,1040,1120,1200,1280,1360,1440,1520,1600]},{"name":"Attached damage","list":[1600,1760,1920,2080,2240,2400,2560,2720,2880,3040,3200]}]},"super":{"name":"Carry Me","description":"Jump and attach to the back of another Brawler.
