Instead, use the Super on isolated enemies to allow your teammates to finish them off, or onto low health enemies to defeat them.","Kit is a decent choice in Showdown as he can chain Supers indefinitely once he has obtained a moderate number of Power Cubes. This process is easier and quicker with his Power Hungry Star Power, and once he has acquired around six Power Cubes, he will dominate the match. He works better in Duo Showdown as he can heal his teammates, control and damage his enemies while being invulnerable, and acquire double Power Cube buffs. His Cardboard Box Gadget is also useful, as it allows him to speed up his Super charge rate, sneak up on enemies, or flee from enemies."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"28/12/23:","description":"Kit could be unlocked early as a bundle for $29.99.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"03/01/24:","description":"The Billy the Kit skin was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"04/01/24:","description":"Kit became available in the Starr Road.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"11/01/24:","description":"Kit's main attack damage was decreased to 1600 (from 2000) in his alternate form.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"11/01/24:","description":"Kit is no longer impervious to all damage when landing on an enemy Brawler.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"11/01/24:","description":"Kit no longer attaches to respawned Brawlers.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"11/01/24:","description":"Fixed an issue with Kit's Super charge rate scaling with Power Cubes when attached to enemies.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"11/01/24:","description":"Fixed an issue with Kit's Cardboard Box Gadget charging his Super at a faster rate when moving.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"11/01/24:","description":"Fixed an issue where Kit could use his Super again if he detaches from an ally Brawler before the current Super runs out.","type":""}],"skins":[{"name":"Kit","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/kit/skins/Kit/Default.png"},{"name":"Billy the","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/kit/skins/Kit/Billy%20the.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/kit/skins/Kit/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[3000,3300,3600,3900,4200,4500,4800,5100,5400,5700,6000],"attack":{"name":"Attacks","stats":{"attackrange":"3.67 (Short), 7.33 (attached)","reload":"0.8 seconds (Very Fast), 2 seconds (attached)","attacksupercharge":"20%","attackspread":"75Â°","attackspeed":"1900"},"statsByLevel":[{"name":"Damage","list":[800,880,960,1040,1120,1200,1280,1360,1440,1520,1600]},{"name":"Attached damage","list":[1600,1760,1920,2080,2240,2400,2560,2720,2880,3040,3200]},{"name":"Heal per second","list":[300,330,360,390,420,450,480,510,540,570,600]}]},"super":{"name":"Carry Me","description":"Jump and attach to the back of another Brawler.
