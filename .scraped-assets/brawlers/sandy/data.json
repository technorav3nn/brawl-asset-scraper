This allows you and your teammates to use the sandstorm to head into bushes and access larger areas while the enemies believe you and your allies are still inside the sandstorm. Once the sandstorm disappears, the enemies will be confused and you and your allies could possibly ambush them.","Sandy's wide and piercing attack makes it very effective against grouped-up enemies. Use this to your advantage to charge your Super faster.","You can use Sandy's sandstorm to hide yourself or teammates when on low health and retreating or to hide from enemies to flank them and ally close-ranged Brawlers to ambush enemies scouting the sandstorm. Sandy's Super is very effective in 3v3 modes because teammates can be positioned stationary while in the vicinity of his Super. His Super allows him and his allies to reach the mode objective, whether it's collecting Bolts in Siege, collecting Gems in Gem Grab, capturing a zone in Hot Zone, and hiding from Hunters as the Boss or sneaking up on the Boss as the Hunters in Big Game.","Sandy is useful in Heist and Siege because of his Super, but Sandy isn't too viable in Heist due to his low damage output. Sandy's Star Powers can be used on offense or defense in these events. You can either use Rude Sands to damage the safe/IKE along with you and your allies attacking, or you can use Healing Winds to heal your teammates while attacking because enemies will be attempting to stop you from attacking, and healing is especially useful in Siege because the IKE turret will continuously attack your team. In addition, in Siege, due to Sandy's above-average movement speed and health, he's ideal for obtaining Bolts. You can also use Bolts as bait for close-ranged Brawlers who can stand in his sandstorm near a Bolt, in which they're invisible, and defeat an enemy who attempts to retrieve the Bolt.","In Brawl Ball, you can use Sandy's Super to cover the ball's vicinity. Use the ball as bait and if an enemy attempts to retrieve it, a close-ranged Brawler such as Bull could defeat them. After they are defeated, use the time to allow a fast Brawler or self-passer such as Leon, Stu, or Edgar to kick the ball to the goal. In addition, Sandy has above-average movement speed, therefore making Sandy an ideal ball carrier.","Sandy's Rude Sands Star Power can be used for area control, and while the damage over time is minor, the large radius and long duration prevents healing and can slowly drain the enemies' health if they enter the sandstorm and the area it's placed on, allowing you and your teammates to possibly defeat them or force the enemy to stay far from the area, which is very effective for area control-based events such as Gem Grab and Hot Zone. Sandy's Rude Sands Star Power also counters other Sandy's Supers. If you throw your Super onto their Super, the damage ticks make enemies visible. This makes it much easier for your team to fight against the opposing Sandy. Sandy's Rude Sands Star Power can also be used in maps with an abundance of bushes such as Snake Prairie or NruhC nrevaC to detect bush-camping enemies.","Sandy's Sleep Stimulator Gadget should be used behind obstacles, in bushes, or around corners to avoid being defeated by enemies since Sandy is vulnerable to damage in this state. Using the Gadget in a sandstorm is also very effective as long as there aren't any enemies scouting the sandstorm.","Sandy's Sweet Dreams Gadget is very versatile, especially in certain situations. For example, you can use it to quickly escape from an enemy, to push past goal defenders in Brawl Ball to score, to stun the enemies in the zone and get quick capturing, or to even save yourself if a Brawler with a moving ability such as Buzz or Edgar uses their ability to rush in and attempt to defeat you."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"18/09/19:","description":"Sandy was added to the game.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"27/09/19:","description":"The Sleepy Sandy skin was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"02/10/19:","description":"Sandy's Healing Winds Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"09/10/19:","description":"The number of hits necessary to charge Sandy's Super was increased to 6 hits (from 5).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"09/10/19:","description":"His Rude Sands Star Power damage was decreased to 40 (from 200) per second.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"23/10/19:","description":"Sandy's health was decreased to 3800 (from 4000).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"23/10/19:","description":"His Super duration was decreased to 9 seconds (from 12).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"23/10/19:","description":"His Healing Winds Star Power healing was decreased to 250 (from 300) per second.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"05/12/19:","description":"Sandy's Rude Sands Star Power damage was increased to 120 (from 40) per second.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"23/01/20:","description":"Sandy's class was changed to Support (from Fighter).","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"17/03/20:","description":"Sandy's main attack damage was decreased to 840 (from 900).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"17/03/20:","description":"His Rude Sands Star Power damage was decreased to 100 (from 120) per second.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"17/03/20:","description":"His Sleep Stimulator Gadget was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"13/05/20:","description":"Sandy's main attack damage was increased to 920 (from 840).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"25/09/20:","description":"The Sugar Rush Sandy skin was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"15/12/20:","description":"Sandy's Healing Winds Star Power healing was increased to 300 (from 250) per second.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"27/01/21:","description":"The number of hits necessary to charge Sandy's Super was decreased to 5 hits (from 6).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"10/04/21:","description":"The Lantern Sandy skin was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"19/05/21:","description":"The number of hits necessary to charge Sandy's Super was increased to 6 hits (from 5).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"01/07/21:","description":"Sandy's Sweet Dreams Gadget was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"25/08/21:","description":"Sandy's Sweet Dreams Gadget stun duration was decreased to 1 second (from 1.5).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"25/08/21:","description":"Sandy's True Silver and True Gold skins were added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"16/12/21:","description":"The number of hits necessary to charge Sandy's Super was increased to 7 hits (from 6).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"29/06/22:","description":"Sandy's main attack damage was decreased to 860 (from 920).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"29/07/22:","description":"The Sandy Koya skin was added.
