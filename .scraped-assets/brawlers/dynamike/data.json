Since the dynamite has a delay before blowing up, try predicting the enemy's movement and throwing it where the enemy is likely to be by the time the dynamite detonates. Auto-aiming almost guarantees a miss against moving enemies, but if in a pinch, auto-aiming is more reliable when enemies are farther away. You may also want to throw two pairs of dynamites in succession in two different areas as it's more likely that at least one will hit and still deal a decent amount of damage.","Hiding behind a wall within a bush in front of it and throwing the dynamite towards the enemy from there can be effective since it's difficult for most other Brawlers to reach you, and they'll be caught by surprise due to you being hidden. This also means that his Satchel Charge Gadget, if activated, will be more likely to hit, which can be devastating towards an opponent and enable Dynamike to easily decimate them.","When being chased by a close-ranged Brawler, try throwing your dynamites a bit in front of you. This either prevents the pursuing enemy from chasing you or deals damage to the enemy. If they are somewhere between 3 and 5 tiles away, try throwing about a tile in front of their current position with similar results.","Try throwing your Super to damage at least two enemies, because as it deals enough damage to charge another Super, allowing you to chain Supers and deal plethoras of damage.","In Showdown, if your enemy is near the gas, you can throw your Big Barrel o' Boom to knock them into the gas for them to take extra damage. The Super already deals massive damage, and when with coupled with the gas, it can secure a defeat against low-medium health enemies. Your Demolition Star Power amplifies this strategy's effectiveness.","In Gem Grab or Siege, throwing an attack near a Gem/Bolt can drive enemies away from it, therefore allowing Dynamike or his teammates to retrieve the item more easily and preventing enemies from retrieving it.","Dynamike's damage radius decreases as he throws the sticks closer to himself, making it significantly harder to hit enemies close to him. However, he can also use this to his advantage as such enemies are more likely to be hit by both dynamites and will take more damage.","Assassins are huge counters to Dynamike due to their above-average speeds and traveling abilities, which help him escape Dynamike's delayed shots, so watch out for them before they can burst you down. Alternatively, if caught by them, you can use Satchel Charge to possibly change the fate of the fight, though this only works if you land the shot correctly or specifically for Mortis waste his ammo so it's easier to land the shot. You can also use your Fidget Spinner Gadget's speed boost to escape before they get too close to you, but it isn't very useful when they've already reached you because of again, assassins' traveling abilities and fast movement speed.","A difficult but rewarding tactic with Dynamike is where you aim Dynamike's Super and quickly toss a main attack in such a way that Super can push enemies into the sticks of dynamite. This deals extreme amounts of damage to them and usually eliminates them unless they're heavyweights like Frank or El Primo. If the enemy had enough health and the sticks of dynamite were perfectly placed, Dynamike also instantly recharges his Super, in which he can chain Supers.","His Dyna-Jump Star Power is effective to escape from danger by throwing dynamite at your feet. This not only damages nearby enemies, but also throws you far enough away from enemies to avoid damage, and allows for a speedy escape over walls. In desperate situations, his Super propels him even further, making it a more reliable tool for escape while also being able to damage and even defeat enemies due to the large amounts of damage dealt by the Super or attack. He can also utilize it to boost him towards vital areas or items such as the zones in Hot Zone.","Though the timing is tricky, it's possible to jump over enemy attacks with Dynamike's Dyna-Jump Star Power. This is rare, but can help in sticky situations when under heavy fire.","His Fidget Spinner Gadget is useful for checking bushes because it covers an extremely wide area. He can also use his Gadget to reliably defeat low-health enemies who are very close to him, which would be otherwise very hard to hit with his main attack. His Fidget Spinner Gadget is also useful in Heist due to the large amount of dynamite it fires, so make sure you move slightly clockwise to maximize its damage.","Dynamike's attack fuse makes it hard for him to defend. His Satchel Charge Gadget allows him to burst enemies down safely, especially low-health ones. This is also incredibly useful in Heist when attempting to take out heavyweights. His reliance on this Gadget makes it more niche in offense-oriented modes such as Bounty, where stuns are valuable tools to have.","Dynamike's Satchel Charge Gadget and Demolition Star Power is a good build for Dynamike. In certain situations, Dynamike can stun enemies and then throw his Super at them. Due to the stun, the enemy won't be able to dodge the Super as people often do nor can they provide counter fire. Demolition deals a lot of damage to the enemy and, coupled with the attack, it'll incinerate out medium-to lower-health Brawlers. For tanks, throw more attacks with the Super to knock them out while they're stunned. Though not necessary, Demolition, if available, should definitely be used because it aids in taking out or heavily damaging Brawlers, especially tanks.","A moderately difficult but useful strategy is double-jumping with his Dyna-Jump. To do this, throw a shot at your feet and then quickly throw another shot parallel and 1-2 tiles away from the first shot. The first shot will propel you forward and if your timing and position are right, it'll propel you towards the second shot for that shot to propel you. It's much trickier with his Super as you'll have to throw an attack further. Double-jumping will take a lot of practice to master, but it can assist you in many situations and if you master it, you can even triple-jump or quad-jump and avoid getting hit for the while that you're jumping.","Dynamike's Demolition Star Power can be used to fool enemies when they head into enclosed areas that you're in. This especially works with Edgar or Surge as they don't have wall-breaking abilities, making them unable to escape from his Super."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"20/06/17:","description":"Dynamike's main attack damage was increased to 160 (from 140) per dynamite.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"27/06/17:","description":"Dynamike's Super damage was increased to 500 (from 400).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"16/08/17:","description":"Dynamike's main attack damage was increased to 180 (from 160) per dynamite.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"16/08/17:","description":"His Super damage was increased to 540 (from 500).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"16/08/17:","description":"The delay and projectile speed for his main attack and Super were decreased to 1.4 seconds (from 1.5).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"12/09/17:","description":"Dynamike's health was increased to 700 (from 600).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"05/10/17:","description":"Dynamike's Super damage was decreased to 500 (from 540).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"07/12/17:","description":"Dynamike's Super recharge rate was decreased by 17%.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"07/12/17:","description":"Dynamike's Dyna-Jump Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"07/12/17:","description":"The health and damage statistics of all Brawlers were multiplied by 4.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"16/01/18:","description":"Dynamike's main attack damage was increased to 800 (from 720) per dynamite.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"Dynamike's main attack projectile speed was increased by 14%.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"Every Brawler's movement speed was increased by 70 points, increasing Dynamike's movement speed to 720 (from 650).","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"23/03/18:","description":"Dynamike's main attack and Super projectile speeds were increased by 12%.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"09/04/18:","description":"Dynamike's main attack and Super projectile speeds were increased by 10%.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"21/05/18:","description":"Dynamike's main attack and Super projectile speeds were decreased by 5%.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"19/06/18:","description":"Dynamike's main attack damage was decreased to 760 (from 800) per dynamite.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"31/08/18:","description":"Dynamike's Super explosion delay was increased to 1.3 seconds (from 1.1).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"05/12/18:","description":"Dynamike was remodeled.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"20/12/18:","description":"The Santa Mike skin was added.
