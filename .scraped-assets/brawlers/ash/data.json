Normally, Ash deals moderately low damage and has a normal movement speed but better potential can be extracted by filling up his Rage bar. Because Ash has a short range, it’s best to deal or take damage in enclosed areas due to the abundance of cover that allows Ash to attack enemies with ease or to heal up.","Ash’s Super in a way can act like Tick’s Super. The rats have low health, so they’re best used against low-health enemies to force the enemies to attack, prevent them from healing, and make them waste their ammo. It’s also niche to place the rats to surround an enemy so that they’re guaranteed to hit them and that his Rage bar is charged significantly. However, be aware of Brawlers with attacks that can hit multiple entities as they can easily eliminate the rats.","You can use Ash's rats to block incoming, non-piercing projectiles like Bea's supercharged shot or a far-ranged Piper shot, especially when Ash is on low health. Place the rats in front of him at the right time so the enemy’s shots hit the rats. You may also auto-aim Ash's Super, which will spawn the rats around him, also blocking the enemy’s shots.","Ash can be used in very aggressive strategies. You can throw his Super onto the enemy team, which will weaken the enemies and charge up your Rage bar significantly. Then, use your fully charged Rage bar's damage boost and your attack's piercing ability to defeat the enemies.","Ash’s Chill Pill Gadget can provide a quick and significant heal to Ash. However, Ash’s Rage will be depleted by using this Gadget. Because of this, it’s best to use this Gadget with full Rage, with low health, and with a close-ranged enemy chasing you so that you can use your Gadget to heal significantly and then attack the enemy while also recharging your Rage and forcing the enemy to flee. You may also gain your Rage back by using your Super after you heal as the rats will recharge his Rage significantly.","Ash’s attack delay makes him vulnerable to high-burst damage Brawlers like Bull who can deal massive damage quickly. When facing these Brawlers, attack them with the tip of Ash’s range so that they can’t hit all of their projectiles and defeat him easily.","Though Ash’s attack and Super charge his Rage significantly, his short attack range makes charging his Rage and Super quite difficult to do. Because of this, you should head to choke points because enemies will usually be bunched up in those areas and Ash can charge his Rage significantly by attacking all the enemies or by using his First Bash Star Power to charge more of his Rage.","Be wary when taking damage to charge your Rage because while it can be charged significantly from taking little damage, taking too much damage can leave you more vulnerable.","As a tank, Ash is strongest on maps with a high frequency of walls and/or bushes.","Ash, despite being a tank, can’t match other tanks due to his relatively low damage at low Rage and his attack delay. As such, it’s best to take or deal damage to fill up his Rage and then use his Rage's damage boost to match other tanks.","Ash with his Rotten Banana Gadget is strong when paired with a healer such as Byron. Since Ash gains Rage while taking damage, a healer can offset that damage and allow Ash to gain his Rage more effectively. With a healer behind Ash, he can use his Rage's speed and damage boost to catch up to enemies and defeat them while the healer provides Ash more survivability.","In maps with teleporters like Luis' Revenge, Ash can wait in nearby bushes next to teleporters and ambush enemies going through or past the other teleporter. This works better with First Bash because he can deal more damage to the enemies due to charging up more rage.","If you have full rage, it's better to not use your super, as the super is intended to charge your rage bar. The only exception to this is to try to finish off a low health brawler."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Ash","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/ash/skins/Ash/Default.png"},{"name":"Krampus","cost":"79 Gems or 2750 Bling","campaign":"Dark Winter Tales","path":"/brawlers/ash/skins/Ash/Krampus.png"},{"name":"Pizza Oven","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Starry Meal","path":"/brawlers/ash/skins/Ash/Pizza%20Oven.png"},{"name":"Piñata","cost":"149 Gems or 5000 Bling","campaign":"Power League","path":"/brawlers/ash/skins/Ash/Pi%C3%B1ata.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/ash/skins/Ash/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/ash/skins/Ash/True%20Gold.png"},{"name":"Ninja","cost":"Brawl Pass Exclusive","campaign":"Brawl Pass","path":"/brawlers/ash/skins/Ash/Ninja.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/ash/skins/Ash/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[5400,5940,6480,7020,7560,8100,8640,9180,9720,10260,10800],"attack":{"name":"Clean-Up","description":"Ash angrily smashes down with his broom.
