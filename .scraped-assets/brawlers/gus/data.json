Because of this, he is more useful in 3v3 modes or Duo Showdown, where he can take more advantages of his abilities.","Gus' Super can be used to protect the teammate who has the most Gems or Bounty Stars so they do not die and lose their Gems/Stars. It can also be used to protect whoever is holding the Ball in Brawl Ball.","Gus' Super has to be used immediately, either offensively or defensively, after activating it, since its health decays very rapidly. After a couple seconds, it won't be useful anymore.","Gus' spirits can be very useful for area control if he's using his Kooky Popper Gadget, since he can hit enemies when they're close to the Gem Spawn in Gem Grab and put spirits in said area. Then, when enemies get close to the spawn to grab Gems, he can use the Gadget to pop the spirits and knock back and deal damage to the enemies.","It is better to pair Gus with melee Brawlers, since his spirits are usually positioned in the enemies' side, where the close-ranged teammates could get close and receive the heal from the spirits.","Gus' Super is used best on assassins with lower health and can quickly approach enemies such as Crow and Edgar, as they can get close to the enemies with less risk of dying quickly, and are able to wipe out the entire team.","This could be a very effective strategy in game modes such as Brawl Ball, and gives your team enough time to easily score the ball.","In game modes like Gem Grab or Bounty, this can be used to turn the tables on the enemy as Gus' team will get a lot of gems/stars.","He is surprisingly able to do lots of damage at close-range and survive because he can use his shield for instant health, not to mention his ghosts that give him health. By rushing on enemies who cannot burst, he can more than likely win."],"voicelines":[],"history":[],"skins":[{"name":"Gus","skins":[{"name":"Default","path":"/brawlers/gus/skins/Gus/Default.png"},{"name":"Boy Scout","cost":"29 Gems or 1000 Bling","path":"/brawlers/gus/skins/Gus/Boy%20Scout.png"},{"name":"Balloon Sally","cost":"79 Gems","campaign":"Brown & Friends","path":"/brawlers/gus/skins/Gus/Balloon%20Sally.png"},{"name":"World Champion","cost":"149 Gems","campaign":"World Champions 2022","path":"/brawlers/gus/skins/Gus/World%20Champion.png"},{"name":"True Silver","cost":"10000 Coins","campaign":"True Silver","path":"/brawlers/gus/skins/Gus/True%20Silver.png"},{"name":"True Gold","cost":"25000 Coins","campaign":"True Gold","path":"/brawlers/gus/skins/Gus/True%20Gold.png"}],"directory":"/brawlers/gus/skins/Gus/"}],"hypercharge":[],"healthByLevel":[3200,3520,3840,4160,4480,4800,5120,5440,5760,6080,6400],"attack":{"name":"Loony Balloons","description":"Gus shoots balloons at enemies.
