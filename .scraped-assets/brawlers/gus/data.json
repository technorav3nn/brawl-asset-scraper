Because of this, he is more useful in 3v3 modes or Duo Showdown, where he can take more advantages of his abilities.","Gus' Super can be used to protect the teammate who has the most Gems or Bounty Stars so they do not die and lose their Gems/Stars. It can also be used to protect whoever is holding the Ball in Brawl Ball.","Gus' Super has to be used immediately, either offensively or defensively, after activating it, since its health decays very rapidly. After a couple seconds, it won't be useful anymore.","Gus' spirits can be very useful for area control if he's using his Kooky Popper Gadget, since he can hit enemies when they're close to the Gem Spawn in Gem Grab and put spirits in said area. Then, when enemies get close to the spawn to grab Gems, he can use the Gadget to pop the spirits and knock back and deal damage to the enemies.","It is better to pair Gus with melee Brawlers, since his spirits are usually positioned in the enemies' side, where the close-ranged teammates could get close and receive the heal from the spirits.","Gus' Super is used best on assassins with lower health and can quickly approach enemies such as Crow and Edgar, as they can get close to the enemies with less risk of dying quickly, and are able to wipe out the entire team.","This could be a very effective strategy in game modes such as Brawl Ball, and gives your team enough time to easily score the ball.","In game modes like Gem Grab or Bounty, this can be used to turn the tables on the enemy as Gus' team will get a lot of gems/stars.","He is surprisingly able to do lots of damage at close-range and survive because he can use his shield for instant health, not to mention his ghosts that give him health. By rushing on enemies who cannot burst, he can more than likely win."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"19/09/22:","description":"Gus' main attack damage was increased to 940 (from 920).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"19/09/22:","description":"His reload time was decreased to 1.5 seconds (from 1.6).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"19/09/22:","description":"The number of hits necessary to charge his Super was decreased to 4 hits (from 5).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"20/09/22:","description":"Gus became available to play in the Training Cave.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"23/09/22:","description":"Gus became available to play in matches.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"10/10/22:","description":"Gus' Soul Switcher Gadget was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"14/10/22:","description":"Gus' Spirit Animal Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"25/10/22:","description":"Gus' Super projectile speed was increased to 3600 (from 3200).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"25/10/22:","description":"His Super can now go through walls.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"25/10/22:","description":"Gus' Soul Switcher Gadget health reduction was decreased to 15% (from 30%).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"25/10/22:","description":"Gus' Kooky Popper Gadget damage was decreased to 1400 (from 1800) per spirit.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"25/10/22:","description":"Gus' main attack healing was decreased to 800 (from 1000) but now scales with Power Levels.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"25/10/22:","description":"Gus' Super shield health was decreased to 2600 (from 3600) but now scales with Power Levels.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"12/12/22:","description":"Gus' flavor text was changed from \"Hanging out in a long forgotten and abandoned train ride.
