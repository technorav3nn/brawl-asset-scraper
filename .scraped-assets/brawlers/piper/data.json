Don't underestimate a Piper's range. If you are a more close-ranged brawler juke her shots by moving side to side while steadily advancing to her. Piper is only easy to defeat at close range, otherwise she will definitely put up a good fight from long range.","Piper can be overwhelmed and defeated easily if she is unprotected due to her low health and very slow reload, as well as the fact that she only does sufficient damage from distance. Piper is most effective when she is covered by other Brawlers on her team. If enemies do get too close, it may be a good idea to use Piper's Super to escape if the Super is charged. You need to aim too because otherwise, you land in the place from where you jumped.","Try to predict your target's movement when firing. Piper's shots are narrow, so you will need to aim ahead of moving targets in case they move out of the shot's range.","Piper has a very defensive Super since it only affects the area right near her, but it can also be used offensively in a riskier play. Piper can rush the enemy team, drop the grenades, and fly away. In addition, she can use her Super to destroy enemy cover to open up the map. This plays to her advantage because her long range is more effective in open maps.","When escaping, always try your best to aim Piper away from the enemy rather than auto-aiming because if you quickfire her super, she will only land in the place from where she activated her super, without covering any distance. However if you are in a very pressurized situation and your enemy has short range, you can quickfire the super because the knockback of the grenades is reliable to distance yourself from them. However, always aim the landing point when you can.","Piper's Super can be used to shape the map to your advantage, destroying walls which your opponents would otherwise be hiding behind. This is especially useful on maps such as Shooting Star, where there isn't much cover to begin with. Due to Piper's very low damage at close range and her low health, she cannot afford to be ambushed by tanks at close range and instead must have an open area which tanks have to cross to get to her, allowing Piper to position herself well and attack the enemy.","Charge up Piper's Super as a priority, as there are Brawlers that can pop right in such as Darryl, Bull, Mortis, and Edgar. If you have your Auto Aimer Gadget, use it primarily to escape as its offensive capabilities are negligible.","Assassin Brawlers are a major counter to Piper due to their above-average speed and abilities that help them dodge and reach her very easily (Mortis's dash, Crow's and Leon's Supers, etc.), so it is best to avoid and keep an eye on them from distance.","Think carefully when it comes to the position of Piper's landing after her Super. Since it takes a long time for her to land, it is easy for the enemy to predict where she will end up. Try going to places that the enemy will take a long time to reach such as across water regions or behind walls, but make sure you do not land close to the location of other enemies.","Due to Piper's attack mechanics, she is very likely to have boxes stolen in Showdown as attacking boxes at close range will be very time consuming due to her very slow reload speed and low damage. When breaking down a box at range and an enemy is close to it, target the enemy instead until they are fended off or defeated and then continue with the box.","Piper's Auto Aimer Gadget can be used to stop Brawlers who are pursuing her at close range since her main attack does very little damage at close range. It can also help Piper land her narrow shots. Since the movement speed of her enemy will be decreased, she can hit them more easily, or alternatively, she can use their reduced movement speed to escape.","Piper's Homemade Recipe Gadget can be used to defeat low health enemies hiding behind walls or to increase the chances of hitting an enemy Brawler at low health to guarantee their defeat. Piper can also take advantage of the extra range of her Gadget to finish off enemies that are out of her attack range.","Since Homemade Recipe homes in on Brawlers and determines their location to an extent, it's a good idea to use it when you know someone is in bushes but don't know where they are. This works best on small bushes, as large bushes will be too large for the curvature of the bullet to reach."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"03/07/17:","description":"Piper was added to the game.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"06/07/17:","description":"Piper's Super recharge rate was decreased by 25%.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"16/08/17:","description":"Piper's main attack damage was decreased to 440 (from 460) at max range.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"16/08/17:","description":"Her Super damage was decreased to 200 (from 300) per grenade.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"04/09/17:","description":"Piper's main attack damage was decreased to 420 (from 440) at max range.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"07/12/17:","description":"The health and damage statistics of all Brawlers were multiplied by 4.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"07/12/17:","description":"Piper's Ambush Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"27/01/18:","description":"Piper's reload time was decreased to 2.5 seconds (from 3).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"27/01/18:","description":"Her damage was decreased to 1480 (from 1680) at max range.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"Piper's main attack damage was increased to 1560 (from 1480) at max range.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"Her main attack projectile size was increased.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"Her main attack range was decreased to be in view of the screen.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"Every Brawler's movement speed was increased by 70 points, increasing Piper's base movement speed to 720 (from 650).","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"All Brawlers' projectile speeds are increased by 9%.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"23/03/18:","description":"Piper's main attack projectile speed was decreased by 3%.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"23/03/18:","description":"Her main attack projectile size was decreased by 33%.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"09/04/18:","description":"Piper's main attack damage increased to 1640 (from 1560) at max range.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"09/04/18:","description":"Her cooldown between shots was increased to 0.5 seconds (from 0.25).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"29/05/18:","description":"Piper's reload time was decreased to 2.3 seconds (from 2.5).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"15/04/19:","description":"Piper's Super damage was increased to 900 (from 800) per grenade.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"15/04/19:","description":"Her Super grenade count was increased to 4 (from 3).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"15/04/19:","description":"Her Super's grenades are placed further away from each other.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"14/08/19:","description":"Piper's Snappy Sniping Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"29/08/19:","description":"Piper's Ambush Star Power bonus damage was increased to 500 (from 400).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"29/08/19:","description":"Piper's Snappy Sniping Star Power ammo gain was decreased to 0.4 (from 0.5).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"29/08/19:","description":"Piper was remodeled, and the Pink Piper skin was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"18/09/19:","description":"Piper's Snappy Sniping Star Power ammo gain was decreased to 0.3 (from 0.4).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"09/10/19:","description":"Piper's Ambush Star Power bonus damage was increased to 800 (from 500).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"09/10/19:","description":"Her Super now drops the grenades in a fixed pattern on the ground.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"23/10/19:","description":"Piper's main attack damage was decreased to 1600 (from 1640) at max range.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"01/11/19:","description":"The Calavera Piper skin was added.
