Because of this, it's best to practice shooting around obstacles, predicting his shot pattern, and predicting the enemy's movement to prevent opportunities for the enemies to damage you. However, his devastatingly high damage output compensates for his low health and allows him to defeat enemies easily.","Spike's attack can deal devastating damage. One way to deal that maximum damage is at point-blank range of the enemy where his attack and Popping Pincushion Gadget work best at that range. This makes him an excellent counter against close-ranged Brawlers like El Primo and Mortis who need to get close to Spike to damage him.","Spike is capable of dealing extremely high damage to grouped-up enemies due to the multiple spikes shot out from his attack on impact. His Super's area damage can also spell trouble for grouped-up enemies since they can't easily escape from Spike's attack or Popping Pincushion Gadget due to the slow effect this becomes more effective using Spike Mythic Gear Sticky Spikes.","The 6 spikes that fly out from his attack always spread out in the same pattern (60-degree angles, or 75 degrees with Curveball) no matter your position or rotation. You can use this to know where the spikes will land, making it easier to hit enemies around corners and obstacles or to check bushes. Because of this, having the cactus explode near a target is vital because this increases the chances of multiple spikes hitting the same target.","When defending a critical objective or controlling an area, Spike's Super and his Fertilize Star Power are useful for area denial, slowing and damaging enemies while healing himself. If the enemy team is fleeing with Gems in Gem Grab or attempting to score a goal in Brawl Ball, you can hamper them from doing so with your Super.","Spike's Fertilize Star Power and Life Plant Gadget are useful for healing if your team lacks healers. If you find yourself charging your Super too often, don't hesitate to use it on yourself to heal you fully while you keep attacking enemies. If you or teammates are low on health and your Super isn't charged up, you can spawn your Life Plant Gadget down, hide behind it, and heal up. The extra healing his Life Plant provides when it's destroyed makes it even better for supporting Spike and teammates. These mechanics are also useful in Showdown when facing high-damaging enemies or in self-defense, especially in Showdown when being ambushed or pinched.","Spike is versatile in Heist thanks to his high damage output he can either play defensively by defeating tanks such as El Primo or Darryl and offensively his Fertilize Star Power allows his Super to cover more area denial in certain choke points on the map thanks to the healing effect it provides. If Spike is positioned correctly or is at point-blank range of the safe, he can deal devastatingly high damage to it with his Popping Pincushion Gadget along with his high-damaging attack and his Super's high damage, which justifies using him in Heist. Popping Pincushion can also serve as a fourth attack or during defense since Spike reloads slowly."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"27/06/17:","description":"Spike's health was decreased to 600 (from 700).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"04/09/17:","description":"Spike's Super's slow duration now decreases once out of it's area of effect.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"05/10/17:","description":"Spike's Super projectile speed was increased.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"07/12/17:","description":"Spike's Fertilize Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"07/12/17:","description":"The health and damage statistics of all Brawlers were multiplied by 4.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"18/12/17:","description":"Spike's Fertilize Star Power healing was decreased to 500 (from 600) per second.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"16/01/18:","description":"Spike's reload time was decreased to 2 seconds (from 2.2).","type":"Buff"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"Spike's main attack projectile size was increased.","type":"Buff"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"Every Brawler's movement speed was increased by 70 points, increasing Spike's base movement speed to 720 (from 650).","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"21/03/18:","description":"All Brawlers' projectile speeds were increased by 9%.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"05/12/18:","description":"The range of the spikes in Spike's main attack was decreased to 4.33 tiles (from 5).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"05/12/18:","description":"The spines now split in a set pattern (instead of randomly split).","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"29/01/19:","description":"Spike and Pinky Spike were remodeled, and Pinky Spike was renamed to Sakura Spike.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"29/01/19:","description":"Spike and Sakura Spike's projectiles were retextured:","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"29/01/19:","description":"Sakura Spike shoots flower-like projectiles instead of the normal Spike's needle grenades.
