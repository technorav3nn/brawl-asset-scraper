This is not what you have to do on melee situations, because you lose time trying to get more range and only one projectile can hit the same enemy.","She is very strong in Gem Grab, able to hold off gems in the countdown. It is advisable to play her as the gem carrier, and play defensively as gem collector, or offensively. She can carry all 10 gems and in the 15 second countdown she can flee and use her Super so that enemies can no longer attack her.","Janet's Drop The Bass Gadget is quite useful in maps covered in bushes, like Snake Prairie and Sapphire Plains, as enemies in her Gadget's radius receive damage, causing them to be revealed, much like Grom's Gadget.","Her Drop The Bass Gadget can prevent enemies from healing, making this a very effective strategy to prevent low-health enemies from being able to recover and fight back. It has a low health, so make sure you put it behind a wall or a place where enemies can't hit it easily.","Keep in mind that Janet's Super does not drop a bomb directly below her, but rather firing them a short distance forward. This means that circling a stationary enemy will likely only hit them once.","The Backstage Pass Gadget is sometimes useful in close-range situations against quick unloading enemies since it may cause the enemy to miss all three shots when you suddenly jump when attacking, reducing the chance of getting defeated and making it easy to finish off the enemy.","If Janet is the big brawler in Big Game, She would almost be completely unkillable as she would use her super, and her gadgets against the hunters. Thus, the hunters would have to rethink their strategies in order to succeed in taking down the Big Brawler."],"voicelines":[],"history":[{"date":"27/04/22:","description":"Janet became available to play in the Training Cave.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"02/05/22:","description":"Janet and her Valkyrie skin were added to the game.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"25/05/22:","description":"Janet's Vocal Warm Up Star Power was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"30/05/22:","description":"Janet's Backstage Pass Gadget was added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"29/06/22:","description":"Janet can no longer activate her Drop the Bass Gadget while using her Super.","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"29/06/22:","description":"Janet's True Silver and True Gold skins were added.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"29/06/22:","description":"Janet's main attack and Super visual effects were slightly reworked.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"31/08/22:","description":"Janet's health was decreased to 3400 (from 3600).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"31/08/22:","description":"The number of hits necessary to charge Janet's Super was increased to 6 hits (from 5).","type":"Nerf"},{"date":"25/10/22:","description":"Fixed an issue where Janet's Drop the Bass Gadget visual effects persisted after being teleported.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"25/10/22:","description":"Fixed an issue where Janet's Backstage Pass Gadget aiming indicator would glitch out.","type":"Neutral"},{"date":"14/11/22:","description":"The G-Force Janet skin was added.
